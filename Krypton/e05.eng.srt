1
00:00:00,039 --> 00:00:02,585
This initiative is about
targeting Black Zero.

2
00:00:02,641 --> 00:00:06,476
Nobody fires unless I give the order.

3
00:00:06,539 --> 00:00:08,005
Let him go.

4
00:00:08,115 --> 00:00:10,382
<i>What happened here?</i>

5
00:00:10,484 --> 00:00:12,217
Kol-Da, you are under arrest.

6
00:00:12,319 --> 00:00:13,585
Lyta, thank you.

7
00:00:13,687 --> 00:00:15,454
I need someone to take responsibility

8
00:00:15,556 --> 00:00:17,489
for the Rankless initiative's failures.

9
00:00:17,591 --> 00:00:19,390
Commander Zod, it's by Rao's word

10
00:00:19,492 --> 00:00:21,333
that you are hereby
charged with treason.

11
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,493
What's gonna happen to her?

12
00:00:22,595 --> 00:00:25,596
She'll be executed just like
your grandfather was.

13
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:26,998
Why do you want to save Lyta-Zod?

14
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,114
Because I love her. Will you help her?

15
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,334
She's innocent.

16
00:00:30,436 --> 00:00:32,403
The moment Lyta dies, so does our chance

17
00:00:32,505 --> 00:00:33,805
<i>to overthrow the Voice of Rao.</i>

18
00:00:33,907 --> 00:00:35,373
I have come to make you an offer

19
00:00:35,475 --> 00:00:37,107
that could save Lyta's life.

20
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,442
For the cost of what?

21
00:00:38,545 --> 00:00:40,344
Pledge your support to my father.

22
00:00:40,446 --> 00:00:42,213
Thanks for always having my back.

23
00:00:42,315 --> 00:00:43,447
It's more than loyalty.

24
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:44,782
<i>Val, I'm headed your way.</i>

25
00:00:44,884 --> 00:00:45,883
Do you read?

26
00:00:47,053 --> 00:00:48,986
<i>Tell me what you know about Brainiac.</i>

27
00:00:49,088 --> 00:00:52,556
Together we can protect
the future of Krypton.

28
00:00:59,106 --> 00:01:00,887
<i>Seg-El is somewhere in the complex.</i>

29
00:01:00,973 --> 00:01:02,072
Find him.

30
00:01:02,167 --> 00:01:05,534
You're my daughter,
and Zods are not traitors.

31
00:01:05,636 --> 00:01:07,670
I think you're here protecting Seg.

32
00:01:07,772 --> 00:01:10,439
If you want to help me,
then for once in your life

33
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:14,510
- trust me.
- Trust runs both ways, Lyta.

34
00:01:16,714 --> 00:01:18,146
<i>What makes a Zod?</i>

35
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,717
<i>Is it blood?</i>

36
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:31,092
<i>Jayna.</i>

37
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:33,893
<i>Vidar.</i>

38
00:01:36,261 --> 00:01:38,892
<i>You were born into a great House.</i>

39
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:43,686
<i>A House of Warriors.</i>

40
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:49,307
<i>Warriors whose courage, honor...</i>

41
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,978
<i>...and loyalty to the State
are without equal.</i>

42
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:57,414
<i>And without question.</i>

43
00:02:12,431 --> 00:02:16,433
You hold back because
she is your sister.

44
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:19,270
Your unwillingness
to land the blow ensures

45
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:22,105
that she will remain
vulnerable to such an attack

46
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,674
from a future opponent,

47
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:27,178
one not blinded by sentiment as you are.

48
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,714
Is that honorable?

49
00:02:38,423 --> 00:02:43,026
<i>To earn the name Zod, you
must place honor above all.</i>

50
00:02:43,128 --> 00:02:46,196
<i>Above love.</i>

51
00:02:46,298 --> 00:02:48,538
<i>Above life.</i>

52
00:02:50,468 --> 00:02:53,536
<i>Even above family.</i>

54
00:03:24,435 --> 00:03:27,636
There. Blood.

55
00:03:29,406 --> 00:03:31,440
He won't last long out here.

56
00:03:31,542 --> 00:03:33,775
Especially with the ice storm coming.

57
00:03:33,877 --> 00:03:36,477
We better find him before it hits.

58
00:04:09,411 --> 00:04:12,646
Okay.

59
00:04:26,828 --> 00:04:28,127
Okay.

60
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:29,996
Okay, okay, okay.

61
00:04:32,267 --> 00:04:35,535
Ah, come on, come on.

62
00:04:35,637 --> 00:04:36,736
Hello.

63
00:04:36,838 --> 00:04:39,172
Hello, ca...

64
00:04:39,274 --> 00:04:42,809
Can any...

65
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:45,178
Shit.

66
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,832
Ah.

67
00:05:43,503 --> 00:05:44,935
Help me.

68
00:05:45,037 --> 00:05:48,305
Please. They'll be back soon.

69
00:05:51,344 --> 00:05:54,544
I know a way to safety. Huh?

70
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,047
Far from these people.

71
00:06:20,906 --> 00:06:22,238
Deactivate the barrier.

72
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,907
- Dev.
- You're a Zod.

73
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:27,377
Wouldn't run even if I begged you.

74
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:30,546
Do it and go.

75
00:06:30,648 --> 00:06:32,548
I'll be responsible.

76
00:06:43,193 --> 00:06:44,293
I should've come sooner.

77
00:06:44,395 --> 00:06:46,061
You shouldn't have come at all.

78
00:06:46,163 --> 00:06:48,964
You really expect me
to believe that all this time

79
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:50,766
you've been a Black Zero operative?

80
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:53,135
Clearly some do.

81
00:06:55,505 --> 00:07:00,142
I was thinking about
the first night we met.

82
00:07:00,244 --> 00:07:03,745
The Nova Cycle First Night Dinner.

83
00:07:03,847 --> 00:07:05,414
Was that really 18 cycles ago?

84
00:07:05,515 --> 00:07:10,085
I couldn't believe my family
got seated with House Zod.

85
00:07:11,588 --> 00:07:12,854
When I saw the Fire of Rao,

86
00:07:12,956 --> 00:07:16,023
I knew I'd never see
anything as beautiful.

87
00:07:18,695 --> 00:07:22,430
And then I saw you.

88
00:07:26,603 --> 00:07:28,002
I paid that Rankless

89
00:07:28,104 --> 00:07:30,171
to spread spark snow in the Fire.

90
00:07:30,273 --> 00:07:33,240
Only you would try
to improve the Ceremonial Fire.

91
00:07:33,343 --> 00:07:34,575
I had no idea it would...

92
00:07:34,677 --> 00:07:36,310
Set fire to the Surrus blossoms.

93
00:07:38,081 --> 00:07:42,683
I didn't ask you
to take the blame for me.

94
00:07:42,785 --> 00:07:45,853
You didn't have to.

95
00:07:45,955 --> 00:07:48,288
I was already in love with you.

96
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:56,262
Look, I know you don't feel the same way

97
00:07:56,365 --> 00:08:00,133
I feel about you, but...

98
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:11,077
I do love you.

99
00:08:23,224 --> 00:08:25,324
He's nowhere to be found and
he's not picking up his comm.

100
00:08:25,426 --> 00:08:27,727
I'm telling you, something
is seriously wrong.

101
00:08:27,829 --> 00:08:29,896
Yes, Lyta has been
scheduled for execution.

102
00:08:29,998 --> 00:08:31,864
It does not get more wrong for Seg.

103
00:08:31,966 --> 00:08:33,499
He will show up eventually.

104
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,567
Great, so until then I'm just
supposed to sit around

105
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:37,869
with my thumb up my ass?

106
00:08:37,971 --> 00:08:39,405
Yeah, if... if you think
that's gonna help.

107
00:08:39,507 --> 00:08:41,040
Be my guest.

108
00:08:41,142 --> 00:08:44,476
It'll probably be a lot
more help than you've been.

109
00:08:44,578 --> 00:08:46,978
Why would you put your thumb...

110
00:08:47,081 --> 00:08:49,214
Uh.

111
00:08:51,885 --> 00:08:54,285
You know yet, we getting close?

112
00:08:54,387 --> 00:08:56,387
How much further?

113
00:08:57,591 --> 00:08:59,323
Hey, come on, stay with me.

114
00:08:59,426 --> 00:09:02,226
I need you to tell me
how to get us out of here.

115
00:09:02,328 --> 00:09:04,195
Straight, we go straight.

116
00:09:04,297 --> 00:09:05,163
Straight?

117
00:09:05,265 --> 00:09:06,830
You said that three straights ago.

118
00:09:06,933 --> 00:09:09,567
How can you even tell?
It looks all the same.

119
00:09:09,669 --> 00:09:10,668
Co... come on, come on.

120
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:11,835
You gotta stay with me.

121
00:09:11,938 --> 00:09:13,171
Come on, keep talking.

122
00:09:13,273 --> 00:09:15,339
What's your name? Tell me your name.

123
00:09:15,442 --> 00:09:18,642
- What's your name?
- Raika.

124
00:09:18,744 --> 00:09:20,445
- I am Raika.
- Raika.

125
00:09:20,547 --> 00:09:23,714
Great. I'm Seg.

126
00:09:23,816 --> 00:09:26,416
Those people back there,

127
00:09:26,518 --> 00:09:28,351
what do they want from you?

128
00:09:28,454 --> 00:09:30,921
Why were they torturing you?

129
00:09:31,023 --> 00:09:33,156
I could not let them find it.

130
00:09:33,258 --> 00:09:35,525
Find what?

131
00:09:35,628 --> 00:09:37,194
That which we protect.

132
00:09:37,296 --> 00:09:39,063
Protect? What do you mean "protect"?

133
00:09:39,164 --> 00:09:40,564
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey.

134
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:52,142
Come on, we gotta keep moving.

135
00:10:14,098 --> 00:10:16,732
Whoa, hey, friends, friends,
friend of Raika's.

136
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:19,968
She's hurt. I tried to help her.

137
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,304
<i>Ha neh fra bor.</i>

138
00:10:22,406 --> 00:10:24,039
<i>Jayta fesu henni Raika.</i>

139
00:10:24,142 --> 00:10:26,775
<i>Yek un gas ka-ta meh hann.</i>

140
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:29,177
Yeah, well, that... looks bad.

141
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,713
Um, that probably doesn't help,

142
00:10:31,815 --> 00:10:34,783
but I used those to pry open
Raika's shackles

143
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,317
when I rescued her.

144
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:37,452
Heroically.

145
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,294
El?

146
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:49,030
Yeah, El.

147
00:10:49,132 --> 00:10:51,232
Seg-El. Yeah.

148
00:10:51,334 --> 00:10:52,767
Very good.

149
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:54,169
Oh, shit.

150
00:11:00,623 --> 00:11:02,838
Do you have any idea what you've done?

151
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:05,240
I'm trying to salvage this mess.

152
00:11:05,318 --> 00:11:07,118
By going behind my back?

153
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,187
To the Primus of the Sagitari?

154
00:11:09,288 --> 00:11:12,690
What makes you think Jayna
is ready to join us

155
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:15,492
and go against everything
House Zod stands for?

156
00:11:15,595 --> 00:11:18,028
The fact that most parents
love their children.

157
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:23,667
And if she does love
her daughter that much,

158
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:26,303
what's to stop her going
to the Voice of Rao himself

159
00:11:26,405 --> 00:11:27,971
and bargaining for a better deal?

160
00:11:28,073 --> 00:11:30,040
You have risked everything, Nyssa.

161
00:11:30,142 --> 00:11:32,175
We need the Sagitari.

162
00:11:32,277 --> 00:11:33,643
She's a Zod.

163
00:11:33,746 --> 00:11:35,812
If we don't stop Lyta's execution,

164
00:11:35,914 --> 00:11:37,214
we lose Jayna.

165
00:11:37,315 --> 00:11:40,050
And then we lose the chance
to make a better Kandor.

166
00:11:40,152 --> 00:11:43,120
A better Kandor?

167
00:11:43,222 --> 00:11:47,957
There's something else
clouding your judgment.

168
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:49,892
Or someone else.

169
00:11:53,398 --> 00:11:56,031
Seg, perhaps?

170
00:11:57,402 --> 00:12:00,936
I did what I did so we
can prevail against a tyrant.

171
00:12:01,038 --> 00:12:04,106
A tyrant with power and a temper.

172
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,941
If Jayna agrees,

173
00:12:06,043 --> 00:12:08,782
and joins us to spare her
beloved daughter,

174
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,387
how do I explain to the Voice

175
00:12:10,488 --> 00:12:13,089
that he won't get
the blood he's asked for?

176
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:14,250
And if she refuses,

177
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,558
and tells the Voice of our plans

178
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,460
before we can put them in motion,

179
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:19,629
then the blood he asks for

180
00:12:19,731 --> 00:12:22,097
will be ours.

181
00:13:03,774 --> 00:13:05,306
How do you all survive down here?

182
00:13:19,222 --> 00:13:21,522
Cythonna.

183
00:13:21,624 --> 00:13:23,187
With her love and blessing,

184
00:13:23,242 --> 00:13:24,959
all things are possible.

185
00:13:25,061 --> 00:13:29,096
Cythonna? The Ice Goddess?

186
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:32,199
The true Mother of Krypton.

187
00:13:35,422 --> 00:13:37,322
You're Cythonnites?

188
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,556
This is a sacred place.

189
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:45,370
You do not belong here.

190
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,347
Why have you come, El?

191
00:13:47,449 --> 00:13:49,816
Raika brought me here
after I rescued her

192
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:51,039
from some very bad people.

193
00:13:51,116 --> 00:13:53,216
Your people.

194
00:13:53,522 --> 00:13:56,897
If they were my people, would
they have done this to me?

195
00:13:57,592 --> 00:13:59,226
But hey,

196
00:13:59,328 --> 00:14:01,227
you don't want me here, I don't
particularly want to be here,

197
00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:02,695
so point me in the direction of Kandor

198
00:14:02,797 --> 00:14:04,864
and I'll gladly be on my way.

199
00:14:07,435 --> 00:14:10,904
You have shown one
of our own a kindness.

200
00:14:11,006 --> 00:14:13,640
Allow us to return it
by healing your wounds.

201
00:14:13,742 --> 00:14:16,435
_

202
00:14:16,506 --> 00:14:17,739
_

203
00:14:18,651 --> 00:14:20,261
_

204
00:14:23,027 --> 00:14:25,276
_

205
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:29,262
_

206
00:14:29,762 --> 00:14:33,676
_

207
00:15:04,124 --> 00:15:07,491
I testified exactly as you told me to.

208
00:15:07,594 --> 00:15:09,326
Why am I still here?

209
00:15:09,428 --> 00:15:11,562
Procedural delay.

210
00:15:11,664 --> 00:15:12,797
Nothing more.

211
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:15,666
Stymied by bureaucracy?

212
00:15:15,768 --> 00:15:17,802
Most powerful man in Kandor.

213
00:15:17,904 --> 00:15:21,005
Second most.

214
00:15:21,107 --> 00:15:25,075
You will be out soon.

215
00:15:25,177 --> 00:15:30,447
And we will be
sipping drinks by nightfall.

216
00:15:30,549 --> 00:15:33,484
Good.

217
00:16:26,937 --> 00:16:29,804
<i>Every moment of your life is a test.</i>

218
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:32,174
<i>One that reveals who you are.</i>

219
00:16:32,276 --> 00:16:35,510
<i>And if you truly are worthy
of the name Zod.</i>

220
00:16:37,648 --> 00:16:40,515
Today is your trial by ice.

221
00:16:40,617 --> 00:16:44,052
You will make your way
to the Jewel Mountains.

222
00:16:44,154 --> 00:16:46,120
You will follow in the
footsteps of those

223
00:16:46,222 --> 00:16:47,922
who have come before you.

224
00:16:48,024 --> 00:16:50,925
Or you will die trying.

225
00:17:05,508 --> 00:17:08,942
<i>At the southern base
is the Sword of Jo-Mon,</i>

226
00:17:09,044 --> 00:17:13,914
<i>the fiercest of all Kryptonian warriors.</i>

227
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:23,890
<i>There you will find the oxygen
that will ease your return.</i>

228
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:32,099
There's only one respirator.

229
00:17:32,201 --> 00:17:33,867
We made it all this way without one.

230
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:37,036
- And we almost died.
- But we didn't.

231
00:17:37,138 --> 00:17:39,672
We can do this.

232
00:17:39,774 --> 00:17:41,140
We're too far out.

233
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:42,642
We share the respirator.

234
00:17:42,744 --> 00:17:44,043
We each use half.

235
00:17:44,145 --> 00:17:45,211
It took all we had to get here.

236
00:17:45,313 --> 00:17:47,447
- We have to try.
- No!

237
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:51,650
Don't you see? This is the test.

238
00:17:55,322 --> 00:17:56,956
We're wasting breath arguing.

239
00:17:57,058 --> 00:17:59,024
We can both do this.

240
00:18:00,561 --> 00:18:01,894
I'm sorry.

241
00:18:01,996 --> 00:18:03,362
Vidar, don't.

242
00:18:03,464 --> 00:18:05,798
Better than letting you freeze out here.

243
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,199
I'll make it quick.

244
00:18:16,943 --> 00:18:18,710
Don't.

245
00:18:18,812 --> 00:18:22,381
Don't leave me here.

246
00:18:22,483 --> 00:18:24,048
Jayna!

247
00:18:25,952 --> 00:18:28,552
Jayna!

248
00:18:31,057 --> 00:18:33,124
Jayna!

249
00:18:33,226 --> 00:18:34,926
<i>You have to make a decision.</i>

250
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,708
You're sacrificing your
daughter for honor?

251
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,711
You dare speak to me of honor?

252
00:18:55,881 --> 00:18:57,781
Tell me, Primus.

253
00:18:57,883 --> 00:19:00,851
What makes you any different
from those who blindly follow

254
00:19:00,953 --> 00:19:03,320
the Voice of Rao?

255
00:19:03,422 --> 00:19:07,390
You'll say anything
to achieve your desires.

256
00:19:07,492 --> 00:19:09,860
That's your code.

257
00:19:09,962 --> 00:19:13,630
Duty is action.

258
00:19:13,732 --> 00:19:15,998
Duty is thought.

259
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,468
What about your duty to Lyta?

260
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:21,871
One word from you and she is saved.

261
00:19:21,973 --> 00:19:25,174
Her rank, her honor restored.

262
00:19:25,276 --> 00:19:29,078
You serve an oppressive ruler
without question.

263
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,480
Why not serve my father

264
00:19:31,582 --> 00:19:32,849
who wants to truly lead?

265
00:19:32,951 --> 00:19:35,484
You aspire to lead,

266
00:19:35,586 --> 00:19:39,688
yet know nothing about being a leader.

267
00:19:44,128 --> 00:19:47,028
Is that a yes or a no?

268
00:19:57,274 --> 00:19:58,574
That actually feels a lot better.

269
00:19:58,676 --> 00:20:01,844
What is this stuff?

270
00:20:05,548 --> 00:20:08,149
Okay, well, not bad for
something that clearly came out

271
00:20:08,252 --> 00:20:11,419
of some creature's ass.

272
00:20:11,521 --> 00:20:13,188
Thank you.

273
00:20:15,158 --> 00:20:16,391
I'm glad you pulled through.

274
00:20:16,493 --> 00:20:20,595
Yes, thanks to you.

275
00:20:27,404 --> 00:20:29,604
What are they saying?

276
00:20:32,074 --> 00:20:34,609
I know it's about me.

277
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:38,478
Come on, Raika.

278
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,614
Talk to me.

279
00:20:42,018 --> 00:20:44,919
They're trying to figure out
what to do with you.

280
00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:47,988
What's to figure out?

281
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:50,657
Unless they have no intention of...

282
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:53,226
letting me leave.

283
00:20:53,328 --> 00:20:54,561
I'm sorry.

284
00:20:54,663 --> 00:20:56,229
If I had known you were an El,

285
00:20:56,331 --> 00:20:58,598
I would never have
brought you to this place.

286
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,567
Well, that seems a little judgy.

287
00:21:00,669 --> 00:21:02,769
You barely know me, except
for the fact that I saved you.

288
00:21:02,871 --> 00:21:04,170
Do you remember that?

289
00:21:04,272 --> 00:21:05,705
You are an El.

290
00:21:05,808 --> 00:21:09,675
You have the power
to destroy everything.

291
00:21:09,777 --> 00:21:12,178
What do you mean?

292
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,413
I've said too much.

293
00:21:13,514 --> 00:21:15,681
Too much? You haven't told me shit.

294
00:21:15,783 --> 00:21:17,917
Why would you think
that I could ever do that?

295
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:21,227
Because the House of El
has done it before.

296
00:21:23,493 --> 00:21:25,251
I can't say any more about this.

297
00:21:25,306 --> 00:21:27,508
What exactly did my family do?

298
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:28,975
I'm sorry,

299
00:21:29,077 --> 00:21:32,056
but all I can say is our duty
to protect this place

300
00:21:32,103 --> 00:21:33,956
from your family has been passed

301
00:21:34,018 --> 00:21:35,550
from generation to generation.

302
00:21:35,652 --> 00:21:38,389
Well, all I can say is that
my family means you no harm.

303
00:21:38,414 --> 00:21:39,646
And I'm leaving.

304
00:21:39,671 --> 00:21:41,638
They will never let you
out of here alive.

305
00:21:43,709 --> 00:21:45,009
Then help me.

306
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:46,469
Help me, like I helped you.

307
00:21:46,576 --> 00:21:48,144
No.

308
00:21:48,247 --> 00:21:50,912
You will tell others about this place.

309
00:21:52,117 --> 00:21:54,039
You're worried about others?

310
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:56,189
Do you know what happens

311
00:21:56,306 --> 00:21:58,940
when I don't go home?

312
00:21:59,191 --> 00:22:01,742
Others come looking for me.

313
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,353
Els.

314
00:22:03,424 --> 00:22:05,538
That's right, yeah.

315
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:09,522
All my brothers, and all
my cousins, and all my uncles.

316
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:12,483
Pretty soon this place is
gonna be crawling with Els.

317
00:22:12,538 --> 00:22:15,460
And think about
the destruction they could do.

318
00:22:16,103 --> 00:22:19,371
But you can make sure
that none of that happens.

319
00:22:19,473 --> 00:22:21,005
All I need

320
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:23,841
is a respirator and a way out of here.

321
00:22:37,573 --> 00:22:40,007
I should've asked

322
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:43,143
for more than just a respirator.

323
00:22:44,746 --> 00:22:48,748
<i>Warning. Oxygen level near depletion.</i>

324
00:22:48,851 --> 00:22:54,120
<i>Warning. Replenish oxygen
supply immediately.</i>

325
00:23:00,228 --> 00:23:02,428
<i>Warning...</i>

326
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,821
It's not too late to stop this.

327
00:24:12,398 --> 00:24:16,300
<i>Jayna!</i>

328
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:22,540
Vidar, he's still out there...

329
00:24:22,641 --> 00:24:24,108
Do not think of your brother.

330
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,111
He no longer has a place among us.

331
00:24:33,118 --> 00:24:35,619
My mother gave this to me.

332
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:38,455
As her father gave it to her.

333
00:24:38,557 --> 00:24:42,659
As you know, it has
never been apart from me.

334
00:24:42,761 --> 00:24:45,161
It is indestructible.

335
00:24:45,263 --> 00:24:48,498
As is your spirit, Jayna.

336
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,568
I saw that from the start.

337
00:24:51,669 --> 00:24:53,470
Your purpose is fulfilled.

338
00:24:53,572 --> 00:24:55,338
And your destiny clear.

339
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,541
You take your place in the House of Zod,

340
00:24:58,643 --> 00:25:00,543
protector of Krypton.

341
00:25:00,645 --> 00:25:01,944
With you serving it,

342
00:25:02,046 --> 00:25:06,482
our people's future is
as bright as Rao's light.

343
00:25:24,502 --> 00:25:26,668
You are a Zod.

344
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:29,938
As such, you kneel to no one.

345
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:31,898
Stop.

346
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,630
Lyta-Zod,

347
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,803
the witness against you has recanted.

348
00:26:40,442 --> 00:26:44,004
All testimony is hereby rescinded.

349
00:26:45,013 --> 00:26:48,020
And all charges of treason are dropped.

350
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:51,984
You are to be reinstated
immediately to full rank.

351
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,139
The Council...

352
00:27:02,518 --> 00:27:04,984
apologizes.

353
00:27:45,485 --> 00:27:46,885
Mother, I...

354
00:27:46,976 --> 00:27:49,243
I don't understand this. I...

355
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,623
I don't know how this happened.

356
00:27:54,233 --> 00:27:57,633
I guess I have Nyssa-Vex to thank.

357
00:27:57,735 --> 00:27:59,604
She'll be expecting
something in return...

358
00:27:59,659 --> 00:28:01,028
You owe her nothing.

359
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,004
Do you understand?

360
00:28:03,106 --> 00:28:05,183
Nothing.

361
00:28:05,943 --> 00:28:07,743
It was you.

362
00:28:09,847 --> 00:28:11,647
You saved me.

363
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:20,722
I thought I was going to die.

364
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:27,128
I just... I can't believe it, how?
What did you do?

365
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:33,383
I know you've truly never
understood this, Lyta.

366
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:36,612
But you've always been my greatest love.

367
00:28:38,326 --> 00:28:40,778
And now my greatest shame.

368
00:28:41,402 --> 00:28:43,145
Mother?

369
00:28:44,365 --> 00:28:47,266
Mother.

370
00:28:51,906 --> 00:28:53,839
Why am I still here?

371
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:55,807
I demand to see the Chief Magistrate.

372
00:28:58,479 --> 00:28:59,744
What is going on?

373
00:28:59,846 --> 00:29:03,782
Where's Daron-Vex?

374
00:29:28,575 --> 00:29:31,542
End program.

375
00:29:55,567 --> 00:29:59,536
I want a full investigation.

376
00:29:59,638 --> 00:30:01,338
I will find out

377
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,173
how a prisoner of the Sagitari
was able to get a weapon

378
00:30:04,276 --> 00:30:06,509
into her cell.

379
00:30:09,748 --> 00:30:11,481
Go!

380
00:30:16,821 --> 00:30:19,321
I must say, you nearly had me fooled.

381
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:24,727
Well, let's hope the Voice
of Rao will be as well.

382
00:30:24,829 --> 00:30:27,730
No, I meant your feelings for Kol-Da.

383
00:30:27,832 --> 00:30:30,733
You did care for her.

384
00:30:33,671 --> 00:30:35,471
Yes, I did.

385
00:30:37,675 --> 00:30:41,377
Very much.

386
00:30:41,479 --> 00:30:44,380
She was a fierce warrior.

387
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:49,217
And loyal to our cause.

388
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,119
And yet...

389
00:30:53,257 --> 00:30:55,657
And yet,

390
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:58,726
you left me with little choice.

391
00:31:00,898 --> 00:31:04,800
A sacrifice... had to be made.

392
00:31:17,347 --> 00:31:20,247
<i>Warning. Oxygen level near depletion.</i>

393
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,983
Yeah. Painfully aware of that.

394
00:31:24,486 --> 00:31:27,387
<i>Please replenish oxygen supply.</i>

395
00:31:27,489 --> 00:31:28,789
Can't do that.

396
00:31:28,891 --> 00:31:31,225
<i>Warning. Oxygen level critical.</i>

397
00:31:31,327 --> 00:31:34,795
- I heard you!
<i>- Alert. Oxygen now depleted.</i>

398
00:31:34,897 --> 00:31:36,831
Fine.

399
00:31:36,933 --> 00:31:38,946
Maybe you'll shut up.

400
00:31:57,676 --> 00:32:01,511
<i>Alert. Oxygen now depleted.</i>

401
00:32:08,964 --> 00:32:10,330
Okay.

402
00:32:25,913 --> 00:32:27,813
Okay.

403
00:32:27,915 --> 00:32:30,883
Come on. Come on, baby.

404
00:32:30,985 --> 00:32:32,784
Come on now.

405
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:35,888
Yes! Yes.

406
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:38,656
Adam! Adam, come in.

407
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,927
Shit. No, come on.

408
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:43,328
This has to work.

409
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:46,131
Adam, it's Seg. Do you hear me?

410
00:32:48,568 --> 00:32:51,403
He's about yea high,
dreamy eyes, legs for days.

411
00:32:51,505 --> 00:32:54,138
<i>- Adam, Adam, do you read? It's Seg.</i>
- Uh, Seg, Seg, yeah.

412
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,807
<i>- Adam, can you hear me?</i>
- Yeah, Seg, I got you.

413
00:32:55,909 --> 00:33:00,478
<i>Adam, there's......ference...</i>

414
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,679
I can hear you.

415
00:33:01,782 --> 00:33:03,580
Uh...

416
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:05,349
Can you hear me now?

417
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:09,086
<i>Seg, can you hear me now?</i>

418
00:33:09,188 --> 00:33:13,190
Adam, listen.

419
00:33:13,293 --> 00:33:15,659
I don't know how much time I have.

420
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:17,728
<i>I'm in the Outlands, and I'm stuck.</i>

421
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,996
<i>I need help.</i>

422
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:22,249
<i>But if things go badly,</i>

423
00:33:22,655 --> 00:33:25,249
<i>there's something I need you
to do for me.</i>

424
00:33:29,442 --> 00:33:31,395
I got your message.

425
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:38,849
How is it I'm standing here?

426
00:33:38,903 --> 00:33:40,451
Rao works in mysterious ways.

427
00:33:40,544 --> 00:33:42,442
Clearly, so do you.

428
00:33:43,256 --> 00:33:45,622
What is going on between
you and my mother

429
00:33:45,725 --> 00:33:47,023
and where is Seg?

430
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,993
- Nobody's seen him.
- Commander Zod.

431
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:53,831
Commander, this man claims
to have information for you.

432
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:55,499
What do I do with him?

433
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:57,568
I'll deal with him. Dismissed.

434
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,882
You remember me?

435
00:34:03,437 --> 00:34:05,037
Seg's friend.

436
00:34:07,174 --> 00:34:08,340
The alien.

437
00:34:08,442 --> 00:34:12,077
- What is it?
- I've got a message from him.

438
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:13,845
In my hand.

439
00:34:23,723 --> 00:34:27,258
<i>Lyta, if you're hearing this,</i>

440
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,761
<i>you know what happened.</i>

441
00:34:29,863 --> 00:34:31,729
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

442
00:34:35,034 --> 00:34:36,968
<i>I wish I knew you were okay.</i>

443
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,970
<i>You've always been the strongest,</i>

444
00:34:39,072 --> 00:34:41,839
<i>bravest person I know.</i>

445
00:34:41,941 --> 00:34:45,142
<i>Ugh, it's cold as shit out here.</i>

446
00:34:45,244 --> 00:34:48,579
<i>I bet you'd survive it, though.</i>

447
00:34:48,681 --> 00:34:51,214
<i>You will survive.</i>

448
00:34:51,316 --> 00:34:54,184
<i>I know you.</i>

449
00:34:56,087 --> 00:34:58,754
<i>Do you remember our first kiss?</i>

450
00:34:58,857 --> 00:35:02,291
<i>I'd give anything to kiss you
one more time.</i>

451
00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:08,631
<i>You are everything good</i>

452
00:35:08,733 --> 00:35:12,034
<i>in me.</i>

453
00:35:15,339 --> 00:35:17,639
<i>And...</i>

454
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:20,075
<i>I love you.</i>

455
00:35:20,177 --> 00:35:21,676
<i>I...</i>

456
00:35:28,486 --> 00:35:30,218
Follow me.

457
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,022
There's still a chance.

458
00:35:34,124 --> 00:35:35,456
That's why I'm coming with you.

459
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:37,025
I've got a general area where he's at.

460
00:35:37,127 --> 00:35:38,960
I hope you got some tech
that can narrow that down

461
00:35:39,062 --> 00:35:40,629
a little bit. Whoa.

462
00:35:40,731 --> 00:35:43,364
Lieutenant Tai, you're with me.

463
00:35:43,466 --> 00:35:45,199
S&R Ops. Outlands.

464
00:35:45,301 --> 00:35:48,403
Suit up. I'll brief you on the way.

465
00:35:51,574 --> 00:35:53,007
Put that on.

466
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,709
Lyta, if you need another
man, I'll get suited up.

467
00:35:55,811 --> 00:35:58,413
No, it's... classified.

468
00:35:58,515 --> 00:36:01,082
I'll talk to you soon, okay?

469
00:36:02,652 --> 00:36:05,152
Let's move.

470
00:36:05,254 --> 00:36:07,254
Rough.

471
00:36:13,029 --> 00:36:15,629
Seg-El was captured
by a faction of Black Zero.

472
00:36:15,731 --> 00:36:17,865
He escaped. He's in the Outlands.

473
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,632
There's a Level 6 ice storm
in that sector.

474
00:36:19,734 --> 00:36:21,201
No way he survives that.

475
00:36:21,303 --> 00:36:23,036
Hate to be the one
to break bad news to Nyssa-Vex.

476
00:36:23,138 --> 00:36:25,472
Secure that shit, Lieutenant.

477
00:36:25,574 --> 00:36:27,707
We bring him back alive.

478
00:36:27,809 --> 00:36:29,842
- Clear?
- Solid copy, Commander.

479
00:36:29,945 --> 00:36:31,545
We're gonna find him.

480
00:37:31,761 --> 00:37:33,977
Seg.

481
00:37:34,863 --> 00:37:36,396
Lyta.

482
00:37:53,287 --> 00:37:55,420
We're close!

483
00:38:09,042 --> 00:38:11,776
We're not gonna stop looking.

484
00:38:12,705 --> 00:38:15,440
There's skimmer dust-off
markings back there.

485
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:16,573
Looks fresh.

486
00:38:16,676 --> 00:38:18,721
Scan for a heat signature.

487
00:38:23,916 --> 00:38:27,250
This will revive him.

488
00:38:33,367 --> 00:38:34,881
We need you alive,

489
00:38:34,977 --> 00:38:38,695
so you can tell us where
you took that Cythonnite woman.

490
00:38:40,065 --> 00:38:43,599
You have no idea how important she is.

491
00:38:47,572 --> 00:38:51,041
She holds the key to stopping Brainiac.

492
00:38:53,345 --> 00:38:54,544
Tell us where she is.

493
00:38:57,549 --> 00:38:59,782
We don't have much time.

494
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,759
Are you okay?

495
00:39:09,861 --> 00:39:11,360
Yeah, I'm fine.

496
00:39:11,462 --> 00:39:14,596
Sweep the place.

497
00:39:17,634 --> 00:39:19,401
Stay here.

498
00:39:19,503 --> 00:39:20,736
Uh.

499
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:29,110
- How you doing?
- Ah.

500
00:39:29,212 --> 00:39:30,379
A little tender.

501
00:39:30,481 --> 00:39:31,713
Sorry.

502
00:41:16,415 --> 00:41:18,148
It's you.

503
00:41:23,694 --> 00:41:25,127
What's so funny?

504
00:41:30,596 --> 00:41:32,396
Who gave you that?

505
00:41:32,734 --> 00:41:34,667
You did.

506
00:41:34,769 --> 00:41:36,867
I'm your son.
