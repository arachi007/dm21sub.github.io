bird had, it wasn't transmittable.

00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:24,959
Not even from bird to bird.

33
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,096
So it had to have come in contact
with Pestilence herself.

34
00:01:28,097 --> 00:01:29,964
It might not be contagious yet,

35
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:34,969
but if Pestilence gets stronger, even
half the strength of the Blight,

36
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,271
the entire city would fall ill
in a matter of days.

When Reign is triggered,
your genome is rewritten.

00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,691

can't shoot heat beams

out of your eyes whenever you want.

81
00:03:33,355 --> 00:03:36,457
So you think there's an enzyme in
my body that triggers a change.

82
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:39,560
Yes. And if we can isolate it,
we can eliminate it.

And no more Reign.

to study you while you're her.

me into her is to electrocute me.

was scratched by the source.

It's a parallel dimension.

174
00:08:46,306 --> 00:08:48,040
It's where you go
when Reign takes over.

175
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,109
It's why you can't remember anything.

176
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:53,779
When your body transforms into Reign,
your mind literally goes there.

177
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,948
Well, we were both there this time.

178
00:08:55,949 --> 00:08:59,418
I mean, I've been suppressing
Reign's consciousness.

179
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:02,989
She couldn't manifest fully
in this world,

180
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:06,392
so she existed in that one
with you, together.

181
00:09:06,393 --> 00:09:08,427
She said they were coming for us.

00:09:08,428 --> 00:09:10,730
- Who's coming?
- I don't know.

00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:15,368
Did you find what triggers
the transformation?

00:09:15,369 --> 00:09:16,535
Not yet.

186
00:09:17,771 --> 00:09:19,972
I need to increase the voltage.

187
00:09:19,973 --> 00:09:21,841
I need more time to observe Reign.

00:09:22,776 --> 00:09:24,043
Okay.

00:09:27,314 --> 00:09:29,782
You shouldn't have gone to City Hall.

190
00:09:29,783 --> 00:09:31,717
Kara said she had it handled.

191
00:09:31,718 --> 00:09:33,819
She's not taking it seriously enough.

No one takes the protection of this

Look, I know what
this mission means to you.

194
00:09:41,595 --> 00:09:43,763
This isn't about me.

195
00:09:43,764 --> 00:09:45,264
This is about the Legion.

196
00:09:45,265 --> 00:09:47,433
And our mission is to save
the people of our time.

197
00:09:47,434 --> 00:09:52,405
There has to be a way to do this
without making a moral compromise.

198
00:09:52,406 --> 00:09:55,174
We base the entire philosophy
of the Legion on Supergirl.

199
00:09:55,175 --> 00:09:58,477
Have you considered that she might
have the right approach here?

200
00:09:58,478 --> 00:10:01,380
Success is the only thing
that matters.

to see who came in contact
with everyone who got sick.

Well, I just got word that
Brainy, Imra and Mon-El

207
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:21,968
have extracted the cure,

208
00:10:21,969 --> 00:10:24,136
and they're manufacturing
doses as we speak.

209
00:10:24,137 --> 00:10:27,039
So, hopefully it's
just a matter of time.

Hopefully. [SIGHS]

I know that you're frustrated, okay?

213
00:10:35,148 --> 00:10:38,684
But there's still a really good
chance that Imra could come around.

214
00:10:38,685 --> 00:10:40,753
You know, and that we can
work with her on this.

215
00:10:40,754 --> 00:10:43,256
She might have some really
important insight into Pestilence.

216
00:10:43,257 --> 00:10:44,890
Yeah, to kill her.

217
00:10:46,126 --> 00:10:47,293
I don't kill.

218
00:10:48,962 --> 00:10:51,163
I mean, you know
it's possible to reach them.

219
00:10:51,164 --> 00:10:53,699
You of all people understand
how important it is

220
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,534
to help whoever's in Pestilence.

221
00:10:55,535 --> 00:10:57,503
Yeah, of course I do.

222
00:10:57,504 --> 00:10:58,838
But I didn't see that at first.

223
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,039
You were the one who convinced me

224
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,842
that the Worldkillers
could even be saved.

225
00:11:02,843 --> 00:11:05,845
So maybe Imra just needs
a little more convincing.

226
00:11:05,846 --> 00:11:08,514
I've been trying. She's...

227
00:11:08,515 --> 00:11:11,884
She's being irrational. She's
just not listening to me.

with everybody who got sick

known for her famous
lemon poppy seed cookies.

234
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:29,435
A Worldkiller that bakes cookies.
That's unexpected.

Wait, let me see.

236
00:11:31,638 --> 00:11:34,540
Yeah. Yeah, I saw her
at City Hall. She looked...

Well, she looked terrified.

She was dead when I got here.

It's not Pestilence, she's human.

the same data you do.

249

I've got every reporter in the

00:13:04,847 --> 00:13:06,648
the city is pretty panicked
about this.

So if you have any information I can
disseminate, that would be helpful.

271
00:13:09,385 --> 00:13:11,219
Doses of the cure are on their
way to all the hospitals.

00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,822
And the Worldkiller is still MIA.

273
00:13:13,823 --> 00:13:16,357
Yeah, but now that Winn is infected,
doesn't that give us another lead?

274
00:13:16,358 --> 00:13:19,160
Yes. The scratch on your hand seems
to be the point of infection.

275
00:13:19,161 --> 00:13:20,528
Don't touch that.

276
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:23,031

and then the burnt face.

manifest until the symptoms do.

could find is a mild anesthetic.

I have the same ideals you do.

You should know you don't get to pick
and choose when your ideals matter.

You either live by them or you don't.

You think this is bad?

00:14:39,909 --> 00:14:42,443
The Blight is so much worse.

00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,717
So if it's between her

and the millions of people who
die by the Blight in the future,

314

But now, I... [SCOFFS]

696
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:42,793
I don't know what to follow.

I was wrong to try
to make you change. Yeah.

700
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:55,305
I never told you
what I saw on Fort Rozz,

701
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:57,608
when Psi got into my head.

702
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:02,046
It was my sister.

- I don't...

Not anymore.

705
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,587
Because of the Blight.

706
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:15,626
Her name was Preya.

707
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:20,431
She was quiet, and stuck to herself.

708
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:23,233
But she always had my back.

709
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:31,141
Then, one day she was gone.

710
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:34,244
I'm so sorry.

711
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:35,679

holding your sister's hand

713
00:38:38,183 --> 00:38:40,517
while she fought the same
disease my sister did.

714
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:44,621
If I had just killed Pestilence

715
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:46,390
the Blight never would have happened.

716
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,260
Preya would still be alive.

717
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:53,197
I would probably do the same
thing if Alex were gone.

718
00:38:53,198 --> 00:38:54,932
You wouldn't.

719
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:57,267
That's what makes you who you are.
