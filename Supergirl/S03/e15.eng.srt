1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:01,958
<i>Previously on</i> Supergirl...

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,843
<i>- What was that back there?
- Cape tricks.</i>

3
00:00:03,868 --> 00:00:05,453
I've been fighting
with a cape for three years

4
00:00:05,478 --> 00:00:06,890
and all it seems to do
is get in the way.

5
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,430
I can help with that.

6
00:00:08,432 --> 00:00:11,099
On Mars, we called it<i> Za-alet.</i>

7
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:14,267
- It means "decay of memory.”
- Dementia.

8
00:00:14,538 --> 00:00:18,407
Worldkillers, unite
beneath the standard of Reign.

9
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:20,720
Now all we have to do is find them.

10
00:00:20,722 --> 00:00:22,521
<i>I think something is wrong with me.</i>

11
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,246
I keep losing time.

12
00:00:25,271 --> 00:00:27,460
Sam, your blackouts are coinciding
with something, I just...

13
00:00:27,462 --> 00:00:28,628
Silence!

14
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,027
Sam, I know what's wrong with you.

15
00:00:33,201 --> 00:00:35,368
<i>I'm gonna make you better.</i>

16
00:00:43,506 --> 00:00:45,111
Start recording.

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,246
This is day three with the subject.

18
00:00:47,604 --> 00:00:50,689
My preliminary findings
show a karyokinetic anomaly,

19
00:00:50,776 --> 00:00:54,049
confirming my initial hypothesis
that she has been transforming.

20
00:00:54,111 --> 00:00:55,408
Mutating into the other.

21
00:00:55,494 --> 00:00:57,588
Subject remains
in a medically-induced coma,

22
00:00:57,756 --> 00:01:00,072
however, further testing
will require consciousness.

23
00:01:00,135 --> 00:01:03,586
So I will now
end sedation on the subject.

24
00:01:05,624 --> 00:01:07,791
Stop recording.

25
00:01:12,297 --> 00:01:13,797
When you wake up,

26
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:16,633
please be Sam.

27
00:01:20,639 --> 00:01:22,806
- Go.
- Astronaut.

28
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:24,309
- SpaceX?
- Spacewalk?

29
00:01:24,354 --> 00:01:25,854
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.
- Space club?

30
00:01:25,912 --> 00:01:27,637
That... That doesn't count.

31
00:01:27,662 --> 00:01:28,861
Why?

32
00:01:28,912 --> 00:01:30,545
Because you're shape-shifting, Dad.

33
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,916
Oh.

34
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:38,301
Human games have so many rules.

35
00:01:38,668 --> 00:01:40,160
He didn't break any of the rules.

36
00:01:40,207 --> 00:01:41,902
You know what, it's fine.
Just let him have it.

37
00:01:41,973 --> 00:01:43,354
- We're slaughtering 'em anyway.
- Hah!

38
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:45,795
Hey, the Martian
Man-Father strikes again.

39
00:01:45,797 --> 00:01:47,549
"Martian Man-Father"?

40
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:50,483
Fine. The Martian Dad Hunter.

41
00:01:50,508 --> 00:01:52,808
Okay. We need more wine. Keep playing.

42
00:01:52,832 --> 00:01:53,943
Yeah.

43
00:01:53,944 --> 00:01:55,872
- I'll come and help you.
- Okay...

44
00:01:55,975 --> 00:01:57,459
I'm really glad you guys came.

45
00:01:57,545 --> 00:01:58,992
Yeah, me too. Me too.

46
00:01:59,139 --> 00:02:01,961
- Movie. Nine words.
- There you go.

47
00:02:01,992 --> 00:02:05,125
Your dad, he's... He's strong.

48
00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:07,951
Yeah, he seems to be
taking this better than I am.

49
00:02:08,015 --> 00:02:11,401
He's doing everything he can
to keep his mind sharp.

50
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,698
- He's...
- <i>The Cook, the Thief,</i>

51
00:02:13,753 --> 00:02:14,924
<i>His Wife & Her Lover.</i>

52
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:17,026
- What?
- Cheating again Come on, Dad,

53
00:02:17,028 --> 00:02:18,428
no mind-reading.

54
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,464
You keep accusing me
of not following the rules.

55
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:22,899
You are one to talk.

56
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:27,003
My son used to wait for me to leave,

57
00:02:27,005 --> 00:02:29,372
and the moment I had gone,

58
00:02:30,068 --> 00:02:33,743
he would switch around the pieces
on the<i> Ok-Rock-Tock</i> board.

59
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:38,489
When I caught him, he blamed
his imaginary friend...

60
00:02:39,851 --> 00:02:41,870
- What was his name?
- Wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry.

61
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:43,666
You had an imaginary friend?

62
00:02:43,792 --> 00:02:45,889
- No, I...
- Oh, yes, he did.

63
00:02:45,891 --> 00:02:48,424
You said he was a fifth-dimensional imp,

64
00:02:48,426 --> 00:02:51,479
who came just to move the pieces.

65
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,237
What was his name?

66
00:02:56,535 --> 00:02:57,767
- Zook.
- Zook!

67
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:00,170
- "Zook! Zook did it!"
- "Zook!"

68
00:03:00,195 --> 00:03:01,263
"It was Zook!"

69
00:03:01,288 --> 00:03:02,739
That was you.

70
00:03:04,876 --> 00:03:07,192
Wait a minute.

71
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:11,481
It's a trouble alert. There's
a big disturbance downtown.

72
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:14,184
Well, time to get back to the salt mine.

73
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,023
What? I like this shirt.

74
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,550
Can't hold your liquor?

75
00:03:34,636 --> 00:03:36,306
- What happened?
- She just went crazy,

76
00:03:36,308 --> 00:03:37,640
started wrecking the place.

77
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,676
You get everyone out of here.
I'll take care of her.

78
00:03:44,914 --> 00:03:46,947
I had the high score on that.

79
00:04:09,895 --> 00:04:14,451
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx
<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

80
00:04:16,748 --> 00:04:19,282
Well, she's a Kalanorian.
No criminal record.

81
00:04:19,284 --> 00:04:21,084
Then why did she go
all<i> Road House</i> on me?

82
00:04:21,086 --> 00:04:22,719
Demos says she wasn't provoked.

83
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,355
Kalanorians are psychics. Empaths.

84
00:04:25,357 --> 00:04:28,191
Well, maybe she got her signals
crossed with another psychic?

85
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,430
I'm not seeing any psionic anomalies.

86
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:37,066
Well, she tore that bar up.

87
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,344
Her species are prone to outbursts
during astronomical events.

88
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:44,040
- Such as?
- Mercury's in retrograde.

89
00:04:44,843 --> 00:04:46,609
- Wait, what?
- Like, astrology?

90
00:04:46,611 --> 00:04:48,478
More like complex luminal
and gravatic shifts

91
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,981
that determine Kalanorian brain
function, but sure, astrology.

92
00:04:52,047 --> 00:04:53,383
Put her in containment.

93
00:04:53,385 --> 00:04:55,551
We have these Worldkillers to focus on.

94
00:04:59,405 --> 00:05:00,471
Anything?

95
00:05:00,506 --> 00:05:02,021
We've been using
every device on our ship

96
00:05:02,046 --> 00:05:04,827
to try and track Purity and
Reign since the subway attack,

97
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:05,962
but there's no sign of them.

98
00:05:05,964 --> 00:05:09,265
As they say on the farm, "Not a peep."

99
00:05:10,123 --> 00:05:12,459
Imra thinks they're looking
for Pestilence.

100
00:05:12,484 --> 00:05:14,068
Who we still know nothing about.

101
00:05:14,093 --> 00:05:16,961
Right. And based on our experiences
with the Blight in the future,

102
00:05:16,986 --> 00:05:19,055
Pestilence should be
the easiest to see coming.

103
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,930
The Blight presents as diseases,

104
00:05:21,016 --> 00:05:23,282
plagues, real Old Testament stuff.

105
00:05:23,313 --> 00:05:24,731
- Winn?
- Yeah.

106
00:05:24,848 --> 00:05:26,881
I think this should qualify.

107
00:05:28,952 --> 00:05:30,218
Whoa.

108
00:05:32,455 --> 00:05:34,308
Brainy and Imra went to check it out.

109
00:05:34,355 --> 00:05:37,566
Ooh! Better them and not us.
I hate the cold.

110
00:05:37,613 --> 00:05:40,228
Very thin skin. Plus,
the rivers of blood, yeah.

111
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:43,664
What if Reign and Purity
find Pestilence before we do?

112
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:46,033
- They won't.
- And if they do, we'll be ready.

113
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,903
Which means it's time for us
to start training.

114
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,272
Teach me how you fight in the future.

115
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:53,908
Think it's time
we make you a Legionnaire.

116
00:06:07,524 --> 00:06:08,790
Relax.

117
00:06:09,859 --> 00:06:11,759
How long have I been sleeping?

118
00:06:13,897 --> 00:06:15,263
Where is Ruby?

119
00:06:15,521 --> 00:06:17,932
She's with her nanny. She's safe.

120
00:06:21,404 --> 00:06:22,703
Tell me,

121
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:24,605
what's wrong with me?

122
00:06:24,895 --> 00:06:27,516
Most of your blood tests
came back as normal.

123
00:06:28,015 --> 00:06:30,945
But I also studied
your salt replication process.

124
00:06:31,915 --> 00:06:33,481
There's trace evidence that your cells

125
00:06:33,483 --> 00:06:36,684
have undergone a mitotal mutation
that I've only seen in insects.

126
00:06:36,686 --> 00:06:38,586
It indicates metamorphosis.

127
00:06:39,178 --> 00:06:40,725
When you black out,

128
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,756
your body seems to be
changing on a cellular level.

129
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,761
"Changing"? To what?

130
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,063
To her.

131
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:51,199
Reign.

132
00:06:52,001 --> 00:06:53,935
I'm not an alien.

133
00:06:54,368 --> 00:06:57,171
I don't have special powers. I bleed.

134
00:06:57,196 --> 00:06:58,539
I get sick.

135
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,571
My adoption papers
say I'm from Scranton.

136
00:07:00,641 --> 00:07:03,477
Look, I know you mean well, but I
don't have the patience for this,

137
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:04,779
I have to go see my daughter.

138
00:07:04,781 --> 00:07:07,682
Wait. I thought this might be
hard for you to accept,

139
00:07:07,684 --> 00:07:11,786
so I also compiled a timeline of the
blackouts so you could remember.

140
00:07:12,042 --> 00:07:13,337
This is the first one.

141
00:07:15,592 --> 00:07:16,991
And the next.

142
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:19,460
And the next.

143
00:07:20,763 --> 00:07:21,996
And the next.

144
00:07:21,998 --> 00:07:24,565
This was a mistake.
I need to go see my daughter.

145
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:33,674
Lena, are you kidding me?

146
00:07:34,043 --> 00:07:35,476
Let me out.

147
00:07:36,312 --> 00:07:37,845
I can't.

148
00:07:39,382 --> 00:07:40,982
You asked me to help you.

149
00:07:45,384 --> 00:07:47,884
She doesn't fight, she hunts.

150
00:07:48,487 --> 00:07:49,986
All power, all aggression.

151
00:07:49,988 --> 00:07:51,722
Stop.

152
00:07:52,224 --> 00:07:54,091
Wow.

153
00:07:54,093 --> 00:07:56,660
Yeah, Brainy stitched this
together from every bank-cam,

154
00:07:56,662 --> 00:07:58,863
satellite image, and cellphone
video he could find.

155
00:07:58,917 --> 00:08:02,199
That's so cool. The future's cool!

156
00:08:02,702 --> 00:08:04,501
Welcome to the 31st century.

157
00:08:04,542 --> 00:08:05,742
Huh!

158
00:08:05,808 --> 00:08:07,671
Yeah, but what's the point, though?

159
00:08:07,784 --> 00:08:10,022
Big chunk of concrete
is not gonna do anything to me

160
00:08:10,047 --> 00:08:11,808
that her fists couldn't do better.

161
00:08:15,156 --> 00:08:16,980
She's playing with her food.

162
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:19,000
That's how I beat her.

163
00:08:19,075 --> 00:08:22,219
Can... Can we rewind?

164
00:08:24,512 --> 00:08:27,824
Yeah, she's got me beat
on muscle, somehow.

165
00:08:28,623 --> 00:08:30,727
But all that power
is coming from the ground,

166
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:33,730
- from that planted foot right there.
- Mm-hmm.

167
00:08:33,818 --> 00:08:35,699
And she doesn't bother with footwork.

168
00:08:36,335 --> 00:08:37,768
So, when she goes high,

169
00:08:38,203 --> 00:08:39,636
that's my window.

170
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,206
It's also where your cape comes in.

171
00:08:44,977 --> 00:08:47,477
If she wants to be a bull,
you be a bullfighter.

172
00:08:49,532 --> 00:08:51,481
I have done something amazing.

173
00:08:51,483 --> 00:08:52,983
Did you find Pestilence?

174
00:08:52,985 --> 00:08:54,751
I have done something okay.

175
00:08:54,753 --> 00:08:55,986
You, come here.

176
00:08:56,422 --> 00:08:57,788
What?

177
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:01,655
I have fixed your old suit.

178
00:09:01,727 --> 00:09:03,427
Winn.

179
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:06,630
Hey, can I say it? Can I say it? Please?

180
00:09:06,632 --> 00:09:08,098
Yes.

181
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,366
Suit up.

182
00:09:14,973 --> 00:09:18,341
I, um, brought lunch.

183
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:26,516
You are worried about something, my son.

184
00:09:27,152 --> 00:09:28,585
Speak.

185
00:09:29,655 --> 00:09:31,154
Uh...

186
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,056
Just...

187
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:35,261
How are you feeling?

188
00:09:35,413 --> 00:09:36,726
Never better.

189
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,405
<i>Ok-Rock-Tock</i> is good for my mind.

190
00:09:40,365 --> 00:09:41,631
Sure.

191
00:09:43,035 --> 00:09:44,501
Memory, strategy.

192
00:09:44,503 --> 00:09:45,869
More than that.

193
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,658
It hears my thoughts.

194
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,640
It connects me to my ancestors

195
00:09:50,642 --> 00:09:53,076
as I navigate
the labyrinth of the board.

196
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:55,045
Centering me.

197
00:09:55,481 --> 00:09:57,047
Easing my mind.

198
00:09:57,313 --> 00:09:59,716
That's good. That's good,
and it's, um...

199
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,852
It's helping?

200
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:05,755
It's been 12 hours and
46 minutes since you asked.

201
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,515
You fear my condition
has worsened in this time?

202
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:10,427
No.

203
00:10:12,464 --> 00:10:14,464
It's just that...

204
00:10:15,434 --> 00:10:17,634
We did bring in a Kalanorian

205
00:10:18,504 --> 00:10:21,104
who had a psychic breakdown at a bar.

206
00:10:21,106 --> 00:10:23,340
I thought I felt something.

207
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:25,075
It was you?

208
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,477
You know I have
been doing the<i> Ta'ar Ka'riq</i>

209
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:29,646
to keep my memories from fleeing.

210
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:32,115
You should have told me
there were Kalanorians here.

211
00:10:32,784 --> 00:10:34,084
I'm sorry, Father.

212
00:10:34,188 --> 00:10:36,686
In any event, I will be more careful.

213
00:10:38,123 --> 00:10:39,789
Now, come.

214
00:10:40,325 --> 00:10:41,892
Play a match with me.

215
00:10:41,894 --> 00:10:43,527
I never tire of beating you.

216
00:10:44,296 --> 00:10:45,521
I got to get back to work.

217
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:48,365
Why don't you bring the game to
the DEO, and we can play later?

218
00:10:48,426 --> 00:10:52,325
As soon as I finish
my game against Zook.

219
00:10:56,642 --> 00:10:58,341
He was right here.

220
00:11:00,646 --> 00:11:02,245
Where is he?

221
00:11:02,648 --> 00:11:03,880
Dad?

222
00:11:06,151 --> 00:11:07,417
A joke.

223
00:11:07,853 --> 00:11:08,919
Not funny, Dad.

224
00:11:08,921 --> 00:11:11,254
Only because you did not see your face.

225
00:11:23,101 --> 00:11:25,502
Have you thought about what I told you?

226
00:11:25,613 --> 00:11:29,306
I get squeamish whenever
Ruby asks me to kill a spider.

227
00:11:30,342 --> 00:11:32,976
How could you possibly think
I could kill people?

228
00:11:32,978 --> 00:11:34,778
I don't think you could.

229
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,047
So, you think
I have a split personality?

230
00:11:37,516 --> 00:11:39,049
Essentially, yes.

231
00:11:39,258 --> 00:11:41,384
Reign is a completely separate entity.

232
00:11:41,386 --> 00:11:45,021
When she takes over, you lose
all awareness, all control.

233
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,190
Your DNA rewrites itself.

234
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:49,506
Please, Sam,

235
00:11:49,587 --> 00:11:53,476
understand that I would
not tell you this if I wasn't sure.

236
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,333
So this is what I get
for asking for your help?

237
00:11:57,002 --> 00:11:58,501
What's that supposed to mean?

238
00:11:58,503 --> 00:12:01,538
You ask an oncologist,
they'll say cancer.

239
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,140
You ask a surgeon, they'll cut you open.

240
00:12:05,175 --> 00:12:08,977
You ask a Luthor, they'll tell
you you're a supervillain.

241
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,853
What?

242
00:12:18,076 --> 00:12:20,490
Just tell him I'll call him back, okay?

243
00:12:22,294 --> 00:12:23,593
He's where?

244
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:30,333
James, I really wish you'd call first.

245
00:12:31,436 --> 00:12:33,503
Yeah, I tried that for a week.

246
00:12:33,505 --> 00:12:34,904
I just, uh...

247
00:12:35,841 --> 00:12:37,507
Figured maybe I had
better luck in person.

248
00:12:38,238 --> 00:12:40,771
Listen, I'm sorry, I'm in
the middle of an emergency.

249
00:12:40,965 --> 00:12:43,676
Oh. I'm sorry. Is everything okay, or...

250
00:12:51,223 --> 00:12:55,191
An employee of mine asked
for help with a problem.

251
00:12:55,576 --> 00:12:58,995
And now that I've diagnosed a
solution, they don't wanna accept it.

252
00:12:59,105 --> 00:13:00,930
Sounds like they need an intervention.

253
00:13:01,003 --> 00:13:03,433
Tried that. It's not going well.

254
00:13:03,435 --> 00:13:06,970
You know, I had a roommate in college.

255
00:13:07,066 --> 00:13:08,308
Great guy,

256
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:11,374
but he started takin' something,
I'm not sure what it was,

257
00:13:11,376 --> 00:13:13,777
but he would come home
all hours of the night

258
00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:15,845
and just tear the place apart.

259
00:13:15,946 --> 00:13:18,348
You know, I tried to tell him
that he had a problem,

260
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,216
but he never wanted to hear it.

261
00:13:20,368 --> 00:13:22,419
So I just kept cleaning up after him.

262
00:13:23,989 --> 00:13:25,955
Did he ever acknowledge
what was wrong with him?

263
00:13:26,725 --> 00:13:28,158
See, that's the thing.

264
00:13:29,261 --> 00:13:30,894
No matter how bad
you wanna help somebody,

265
00:13:30,896 --> 00:13:33,430
all you can really do
is hold up a mirror.

266
00:13:44,142 --> 00:13:45,408
Wow.

267
00:13:47,245 --> 00:13:49,979
You always said I cleaned up nicely.

268
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,483
It's just like old times, huh?

269
00:13:54,695 --> 00:13:55,860
Training again.

270
00:13:55,885 --> 00:13:58,088
Except I basically had to
twist your arm to train.

271
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,623
You had no interest in being a hero.

272
00:14:01,226 --> 00:14:02,692
And now...

273
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:05,595
I've come a long way.

274
00:14:07,566 --> 00:14:08,832
You ready?

275
00:14:09,468 --> 00:14:11,301
Yeah, I was born ready.

276
00:14:19,378 --> 00:14:22,145
If she's not gonna
use her feet, use yours.

277
00:14:22,147 --> 00:14:24,347
But can my cape even do that?

278
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:26,297
Yeah.

279
00:14:26,856 --> 00:14:28,455
I did not know that.

280
00:14:28,724 --> 00:14:30,987
Yeah, I won't either
for another 1,000 years.

281
00:14:30,989 --> 00:14:32,481
We studied your cape to make mine,

282
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:34,753
it's Kryptonian meta-material.

283
00:14:35,503 --> 00:14:36,802
Smartcloth.

284
00:14:37,362 --> 00:14:38,561
Show me.

285
00:14:40,832 --> 00:14:43,933
Dad, while you're here, why
don't I run you by the Med bay,

286
00:14:43,935 --> 00:14:45,668
have Alex run some new scans on you?

287
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:49,372
- Shouldn't take long.
- No. It is time for me to pray.

288
00:14:51,943 --> 00:14:54,544
Hey, any sign of the Worldkillers?

289
00:14:54,546 --> 00:14:55,678
Still nothin'.

290
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,779
Well, you can catch a break,

291
00:14:56,804 --> 00:14:58,915
I'm gonna take over scanning
for a while.

292
00:15:05,924 --> 00:15:07,056
I know what I'm doing.

293
00:15:07,058 --> 00:15:08,491
You don't need to
take over anything, Schott.

294
00:15:08,493 --> 00:15:10,727
I didn't say that you didn't
know what you were doing.

295
00:15:10,752 --> 00:15:12,362
You need to get out of here right now.

296
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,426
Damn.

297
00:15:19,483 --> 00:15:20,982
Keep your back foot planted.

298
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,405
You have it.

299
00:15:31,049 --> 00:15:32,682
Why isn't this working?

300
00:15:33,852 --> 00:15:35,118
I don't know.

301
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:47,295
I mean, the steps are easy,
I should be getting this.

302
00:15:47,366 --> 00:15:48,665
Well, go easy on yourself.

303
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:50,326
The first time you trained me,

304
00:15:50,351 --> 00:15:52,569
you kicked me around the room
like a hacky sack.

305
00:15:52,571 --> 00:15:53,837
It was humbling.

306
00:15:53,921 --> 00:15:55,936
- I was...
- Hungover.

307
00:15:56,064 --> 00:15:57,541
You were hungover.

308
00:15:57,543 --> 00:15:58,742
I'd forgotten that part.

309
00:15:58,744 --> 00:16:00,477
Can we keep training, please?

310
00:16:05,117 --> 00:16:07,284
'Cause I programmed the system.

311
00:16:07,309 --> 00:16:10,576
I input every parameter, every
radiation marker to trace them,

312
00:16:10,609 --> 00:16:13,732
so, yeah. Yeah, I think
that makes me the expert.

313
00:16:14,126 --> 00:16:15,259
Throw the punch.

314
00:16:15,747 --> 00:16:17,494
- Maybe we should take a break.
- Throw it.

315
00:16:29,441 --> 00:16:31,809
The rest of us were the
experts before you got here

316
00:16:31,811 --> 00:16:33,577
and traded your friendship
with Supergirl

317
00:16:33,602 --> 00:16:35,354
for favor with Director J'onzz.

318
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:36,901
Oh, if you were in charge,

319
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:39,510
we'd still be wondering
if Reign was an alien.

320
00:17:00,906 --> 00:17:03,507
You egotistical little son
of a serial killer.

321
00:17:05,752 --> 00:17:06,952
Kara?

322
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,291
Get off me.

323
00:17:21,527 --> 00:17:22,926
Now.

324
00:17:29,767 --> 00:17:31,433
Really, coward?

325
00:17:31,435 --> 00:17:33,135
Have you ever even held a gun before?

326
00:17:33,771 --> 00:17:35,003
I'm holding one now.

327
00:17:36,268 --> 00:17:38,231
Hey! Hey!

328
00:17:38,606 --> 00:17:40,172
Knock it off!

329
00:17:40,317 --> 00:17:41,777
Knock it off!

330
00:17:45,243 --> 00:17:47,143
I am always cleaning up your messes.

331
00:17:47,145 --> 00:17:48,609
Get out of my face!

332
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,304
Hey! Hey, break it up! Come on!

333
00:17:55,351 --> 00:17:56,619
Off of him.

334
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,861
What the hell just happened?

335
00:18:10,935 --> 00:18:12,168
It was a psychic anomaly.

336
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:14,103
I put a barrier up to protect you all.

337
00:18:14,587 --> 00:18:18,063
Oh, God. Winn, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

338
00:18:18,134 --> 00:18:20,665
I'm kind of... I feel like
I'm gonna bleed. Yup.

339
00:18:21,446 --> 00:18:24,647
Demos, man, I'm so sorry. I'm...

340
00:18:25,383 --> 00:18:26,649
Hey, I'm sorry for what I said.

341
00:18:26,651 --> 00:18:29,085
For the record,
I think you're super smart.

342
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:30,286
You're great.

343
00:18:30,288 --> 00:18:32,822
It's like what I saw
the Kalanorian do in the bar.

344
00:18:32,824 --> 00:18:34,623
I told you she needed more observation.

345
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:37,540
- Well, it's still visiting hours.
- Let's go see her.

346
00:18:37,565 --> 00:18:38,837
In the meantime, Agent Schott,

347
00:18:38,862 --> 00:18:40,674
round up the inhibitors
we used against Psi.

348
00:18:40,706 --> 00:18:43,240
Recalibrate them. Make sure
there's enough to go around.

349
00:18:43,284 --> 00:18:46,045
I didn't take enough precautions
last time, I will now.

350
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,370
Come on.

351
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:50,740
It's a good thing
you came when you did, man.

352
00:18:51,976 --> 00:18:54,076
Yeah, good thing.

353
00:18:58,683 --> 00:19:01,081
I've never felt anything like that.

354
00:19:01,143 --> 00:19:02,952
It's like something
was inside of my brain.

355
00:19:02,954 --> 00:19:04,687
I couldn't control it.

356
00:19:05,556 --> 00:19:07,923
- Are you okay?
- I felt it, too.

357
00:19:08,042 --> 00:19:09,417
Wait a minute, you were affected?

358
00:19:09,472 --> 00:19:11,405
I hit Mon-El.

359
00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:12,640
Hard.

360
00:19:13,308 --> 00:19:17,111
We... We were training,
and I was frustrated

361
00:19:17,113 --> 00:19:18,946
'cause I wasn't getting it,

362
00:19:18,971 --> 00:19:21,323
and then he brought up our past,

363
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:24,218
when I used to train him, and
that's when the rage set in.

364
00:19:25,554 --> 00:19:27,554
Are you sure you were affected?

365
00:19:27,556 --> 00:19:29,256
What do you mean? Of course, I was.

366
00:19:30,167 --> 00:19:33,427
It seems like you two still
have some unresolved issues.

367
00:19:33,429 --> 00:19:35,929
Maybe it's not a good idea
you train with him.

368
00:19:35,931 --> 00:19:38,132
That's ridiculous.

369
00:19:40,002 --> 00:19:43,570
No, whatever issues
I had with Mon-El before,

370
00:19:43,651 --> 00:19:45,005
those are behind me.

371
00:19:45,007 --> 00:19:47,107
Our relationship
is strictly professional.

372
00:19:47,109 --> 00:19:49,576
This is just about getting Reign.

373
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,517
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

374
00:19:54,828 --> 00:19:56,395
- Turn her on her side.
- Okay. Okay.

375
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,285
- Okay.
- Prep the Med bay, we got incoming.

376
00:20:03,155 --> 00:20:04,525
What's she saying?

377
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:07,294
I don't know,
but it is definitely Martian.

378
00:20:14,136 --> 00:20:16,170
I just wanna go home,

379
00:20:16,195 --> 00:20:18,172
Lena, please?

380
00:20:18,389 --> 00:20:20,240
Please let me out of here.

381
00:20:21,677 --> 00:20:24,545
I wanna get you home to your
daughter as much as you do.

382
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,313
Believe me.

383
00:20:27,764 --> 00:20:29,397
I am just trying to protect you.

384
00:20:29,945 --> 00:20:31,544
Both of you.

385
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:32,920
I told you this before,

386
00:20:32,922 --> 00:20:35,889
if I had hurt people, I would remember.

387
00:20:35,891 --> 00:20:37,558
You're right.

388
00:20:38,461 --> 00:20:39,927
You would remember.

389
00:20:41,042 --> 00:20:44,977
On some deep level, you would
feel what you had done.

390
00:20:45,696 --> 00:20:48,535
When you look at this, do you
remember what it was like?

391
00:20:48,537 --> 00:20:50,237
Attacking Morgan Edge?

392
00:20:50,469 --> 00:20:53,307
What I wouldn't have given to
have seen that one up close.

393
00:20:54,944 --> 00:20:57,144
No? No recollection?

394
00:20:58,214 --> 00:21:01,281
Supergirl? I mean, that's
a difficult one to forget.

395
00:21:01,382 --> 00:21:04,318
Having your fist connect with
something so solid, so powerful.

396
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:07,454
- This is insane.
- How did it feel to obliterate?

397
00:21:07,456 --> 00:21:10,057
You tore those men apart. You
ripped the limbs from their body

398
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:11,494
and you dragged them across the beach!

399
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:13,127
Why are you doing this?

400
00:21:13,268 --> 00:21:14,401
Why?

401
00:21:14,497 --> 00:21:16,997
I just wanna go home to my daughter!

402
00:21:16,999 --> 00:21:19,967
Like I'd let someone like you near Ruby.

403
00:21:20,396 --> 00:21:22,603
- How dare you?
- What did it feel like?

404
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,339
Living in that house, day in, day out,

405
00:21:25,405 --> 00:21:27,007
pretending to be her mother?

406
00:21:27,397 --> 00:21:30,144
Watching her sleep, so vulnerable.

407
00:21:30,233 --> 00:21:32,061
Knowing that any minute
you could rip her apart

408
00:21:32,115 --> 00:21:33,793
with your bare hands.

409
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:37,107
You're not a mother, you're a monster.

410
00:21:37,219 --> 00:21:39,086
And I will make sure
you never see Ruby again.

411
00:21:39,088 --> 00:21:40,287
Enough!

412
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:09,982
J'onn, you knew?

413
00:22:10,013 --> 00:22:12,220
I didn't wanna believe
it was getting worse.

414
00:22:15,095 --> 00:22:18,297
My father has been using a Martian
practice called <i>Ta'ar Ka'riq</i>

415
00:22:18,322 --> 00:22:20,070
to move his memories and emotions

416
00:22:20,094 --> 00:22:21,640
from the decaying parts of his mind

417
00:22:21,665 --> 00:22:22,764
to the healthy parts.

418
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:25,890
But it takes
tremendous amounts of energy.

419
00:22:27,094 --> 00:22:29,627
Sometimes psychic bleeds can happen.

420
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,796
And the more powerful the Martian,

421
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:33,098
the more powerful the bleed.

422
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,100
Other psychic species, like Kalanorians,

423
00:22:35,102 --> 00:22:36,901
would be the first to feel the effects.

424
00:22:36,903 --> 00:22:38,603
When an attack intensifies,

425
00:22:38,605 --> 00:22:40,338
it can affect anyone in close proximity,

426
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,173
and not just other psychics.

427
00:22:43,443 --> 00:22:46,277
I brought Myr'nn to the DEO because I...

428
00:22:46,392 --> 00:22:48,283
felt I could put a shield
over this place

429
00:22:48,338 --> 00:22:50,267
and keep you all safe, but...

430
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,654
My father's angry about
what's happening to his mind.

431
00:22:57,791 --> 00:23:00,025
And his aggression was being
funneled into all of you.

432
00:23:00,574 --> 00:23:04,062
Can't you help him
with the dampening technology?

433
00:23:04,824 --> 00:23:07,932
He has relied
on his mind his entire life.

434
00:23:10,053 --> 00:23:12,454
First, as a theologian,

435
00:23:14,374 --> 00:23:16,141
and then as a prisoner.

436
00:23:20,047 --> 00:23:22,414
It's what kept him alive for 300 years.

437
00:23:22,754 --> 00:23:24,934
The White Martians may have
had him locked in a cage,

438
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:26,184
but he was still free.

439
00:23:26,186 --> 00:23:30,221
This technology
would make him reliant on me.

440
00:23:32,492 --> 00:23:35,811
It would strip him of the one thing
the White Martians never could.

441
00:23:35,912 --> 00:23:38,229
His independence, his, um...

442
00:23:40,267 --> 00:23:41,900
His dignity.

443
00:23:45,705 --> 00:23:50,041
I remember sitting in my kitchen
when my mom got the call

444
00:23:50,043 --> 00:23:53,778
that my grandmother
drove through a traffic light.

445
00:23:55,582 --> 00:23:58,516
By the grace of God, nobody was hurt.

446
00:23:59,753 --> 00:24:03,154
That was one of the hardest
things my mom had to do,

447
00:24:03,672 --> 00:24:05,539
taking away her keys.

448
00:24:06,187 --> 00:24:09,155
She told my mom off, and she cried.

449
00:24:09,684 --> 00:24:12,320
Suddenly she's in this position
she's never been in before.

450
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:15,270
She's an adult
being treated like a child.

451
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:18,526
And it was ugly, and painful.

452
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:20,472
But it's what had to be done.

453
00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:24,224
For her protection.
For everyone's protection.

454
00:24:25,979 --> 00:24:28,932
I can face down the toughest
adversaries without fear,

455
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,447
but talking to my father about this...

456
00:24:37,188 --> 00:24:39,888
I don't wanna take away more
from him than he's already lost.

457
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,927
I just got him back.

458
00:24:45,629 --> 00:24:47,196
The practice of<i> Ta'ar Ka'riq</i>

459
00:24:47,198 --> 00:24:49,598
keeps him as close
to the man I've always known,

460
00:24:49,632 --> 00:24:51,031
and I...

461
00:24:52,503 --> 00:24:54,370
I don't wanna give that up.

462
00:24:55,339 --> 00:24:57,606
My uncle Jor-El used to say,

463
00:24:57,809 --> 00:25:01,577
"The son becomes the father,
and the father the son."

464
00:25:19,633 --> 00:25:21,139
<i>Lena, why are you doing this?</i>

465
00:25:21,164 --> 00:25:23,042
<i>Just let me go home to my daughter!</i>

466
00:25:23,067 --> 00:25:25,934
<i>Like I'd ever let
someone like you near Ruby.</i>

467
00:25:26,814 --> 00:25:28,203
<i>How dare you?</i>

468
00:25:28,249 --> 00:25:29,867
<i>How did it feel living in that house,</i>

469
00:25:29,892 --> 00:25:31,280
<i>pretending to be her mother?</i>

470
00:25:31,305 --> 00:25:33,375
<i>You're not a mother, you're a monster.</i>

471
00:25:33,377 --> 00:25:35,377
<i>And I'm gonna make sure
you never see Ruby again.</i>

472
00:25:35,379 --> 00:25:36,720
<i>Enough!</i>

473
00:25:44,018 --> 00:25:47,400
Oh, my God! Stop! Stop!
No, make it stop!

474
00:25:49,427 --> 00:25:51,460
I needed you to see it for yourself.

475
00:25:56,467 --> 00:25:58,300
All those people...

476
00:26:01,205 --> 00:26:02,905
It wasn't your fault.

477
00:26:02,907 --> 00:26:04,273
You weren't in control.

478
00:26:05,743 --> 00:26:07,776
When you transformed,
I was finally able to get

479
00:26:07,778 --> 00:26:09,244
some data on Reign's DNA, okay?

480
00:26:09,246 --> 00:26:11,793
We have knowledge now,
and knowledge is power.

481
00:26:11,882 --> 00:26:13,082
Hey,

482
00:26:13,426 --> 00:26:14,983
we're gonna get you through this.

483
00:26:17,354 --> 00:26:18,620
It's okay.

484
00:26:32,636 --> 00:26:34,503
Footwork looks excellent.

485
00:26:35,439 --> 00:26:36,505
Thanks.

486
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,663
So, you, uh...

487
00:26:39,777 --> 00:26:41,176
You punched me.

488
00:26:41,512 --> 00:26:42,845
Yeah.

489
00:26:44,148 --> 00:26:46,466
Didn't feel like part of the sparring.
Can we talk about it?

490
00:26:46,491 --> 00:26:48,383
I'm... I'm really sorry.

491
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:51,153
I think it was Myr'nn's psychic episode.

492
00:26:51,856 --> 00:26:53,589
Why weren't you affected?

493
00:26:53,942 --> 00:26:55,991
Yeah, the Legion ring acts as a shield.

494
00:26:56,894 --> 00:26:59,128
- Huh.
- Another perk from the future.

495
00:27:01,332 --> 00:27:03,732
- Are you sure that's all it was?
- Yeah.

496
00:27:03,734 --> 00:27:05,934
- Nothing between us?
- No.

497
00:27:05,994 --> 00:27:08,137
'Cause, look, I thought...
I thought we were in a good place.

498
00:27:08,139 --> 00:27:09,571
But if we need to stop, we'll just...

499
00:27:09,595 --> 00:27:11,907
No, it's fine. This is...
This is a good thing.

500
00:27:12,595 --> 00:27:15,144
There are Worldkillers
out there, we have...

501
00:27:15,546 --> 00:27:16,945
Let's do this.

502
00:27:18,816 --> 00:27:20,048
I'm ready.

503
00:27:20,484 --> 00:27:21,917
Okay.

504
00:27:37,301 --> 00:27:39,101
Why did you bring me in here?

505
00:27:40,704 --> 00:27:42,404
Just to talk.

506
00:27:42,406 --> 00:27:45,040
I'd prefer to go back to my prayer room.

507
00:27:45,251 --> 00:27:47,676
Or, better yet, take me home.

508
00:27:48,072 --> 00:27:50,078
I'm afraid I can't do that.

509
00:27:51,148 --> 00:27:53,081
As you've been struggling
with your illness,

510
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:55,350
your psychic waves have escaped.

511
00:27:55,524 --> 00:27:58,587
It's... It's affecting people.

512
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,522
No.

513
00:28:01,091 --> 00:28:03,425
I would know if it did.

514
00:28:03,961 --> 00:28:05,594
I've done nothing wrong.

515
00:28:05,749 --> 00:28:07,829
I would never hurt anyone.

516
00:28:07,929 --> 00:28:10,365
No one thinks you're trying
to hurt them, Father.

517
00:28:12,102 --> 00:28:14,570
It happened with the Kalanorian.

518
00:28:14,972 --> 00:28:16,638
A Kalanorian?

519
00:28:17,241 --> 00:28:18,807
On this planet?

520
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:21,276
Why didn't you tell me about this?

521
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:24,146
- We spoke about it.
- We did no such thing.

522
00:28:24,797 --> 00:28:27,130
- Dad, you're forgetting.
- No!

523
00:28:27,219 --> 00:28:29,451
I will get control of it.

524
00:28:29,453 --> 00:28:33,843
I'm afraid you are not
able to. Not by yourself.

525
00:28:33,868 --> 00:28:39,995
Don't you dare tell your father
what he is or isn't able to do!

526
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,801
Good. You didn't dip
the shoulder. That's good.

527
00:28:49,567 --> 00:28:52,113
Hey, we survived a black hole, we
can get through this together.

528
00:28:52,138 --> 00:28:53,575
Come on, try it again.

529
00:28:58,682 --> 00:29:00,048
You just missed the pivot.

530
00:29:00,201 --> 00:29:03,518
- Keep your left foot...
- Will you shut up?

531
00:29:04,084 --> 00:29:07,309
- Please. Please, Father, just...
- What are these for?

532
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:11,059
They're just in case.
They suppress our powers.

533
00:29:11,061 --> 00:29:13,495
Is that to help me, too?

534
00:29:14,632 --> 00:29:16,999
It's to help quell your mind, Father.

535
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,326
So that I may assist you in
the practice of<i> Ta'ar Ka'riq.</i>

536
00:29:21,351 --> 00:29:24,806
You would cage me?

537
00:29:28,946 --> 00:29:30,178
Never.

538
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,748
You're right. We have been
through a lot together.

539
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:35,250
Like that time when you promised
you wouldn't leave the DEO,

540
00:29:35,252 --> 00:29:37,663
and instead you ran off, you got wasted.

541
00:29:37,688 --> 00:29:41,223
You were reckless, selfish, you lied,

542
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,758
and you didn't apologize.

543
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,226
- Kara, I...
- And then there was the time

544
00:29:44,228 --> 00:29:45,560
I got you a job a CatCo.

545
00:29:45,562 --> 00:29:49,398
I vouched for you
at my place of employment.

546
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,700
And then you had Eve
do all of your work for you,

547
00:29:51,702 --> 00:29:53,752
and then you screwed her in the closet.

548
00:29:53,776 --> 00:29:57,745
You didn't apologize for that.
And, shocker, I apologized to you

549
00:29:57,747 --> 00:29:59,634
for trying to make you
into a better person.

550
00:29:59,721 --> 00:30:01,287
I hear you. I get it.

551
00:30:01,289 --> 00:30:03,256
No, I don't think you do get it.

552
00:30:03,258 --> 00:30:08,328
I don't think you get that I gave
my heart to a lying jackass,

553
00:30:08,369 --> 00:30:10,997
who was unaware
of his behavior towards me,

554
00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:12,766
who disrespected me at every turn,

555
00:30:12,768 --> 00:30:15,068
and now is this reformed
person who, what,

556
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:17,303
he wants to reminisce
about the good times?

557
00:30:17,305 --> 00:30:18,838
Kara, put this on.

558
00:30:34,823 --> 00:30:36,202
What did I just do?

559
00:30:36,257 --> 00:30:39,793
For 300 years, I lived in a cell.

560
00:30:39,888 --> 00:30:43,963
My son will not put me back in one!

561
00:30:45,023 --> 00:30:46,256
Father.

562
00:30:52,374 --> 00:30:54,666
<i>Containment breach.</i>

563
00:30:54,736 --> 00:30:56,543
<i>Containment breach.</i>

564
00:30:56,882 --> 00:30:58,449
<i>Containment breach.</i>

565
00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:00,282
<i>Containment breech.</i>

566
00:31:00,755 --> 00:31:02,688
<i>Containment breach.</i>

567
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:04,333
<i>Containment breach.</i>

568
00:31:04,396 --> 00:31:05,933
Myr'nn.

569
00:31:32,662 --> 00:31:33,828
Hey, bud.

570
00:31:34,868 --> 00:31:36,404
Winn Schott!

571
00:31:36,498 --> 00:31:38,266
Pam from HR?

572
00:31:39,389 --> 00:31:40,829
Oh, God. Uh...

573
00:31:45,432 --> 00:31:46,697
Oh...

574
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:49,905
Sorry.

575
00:31:58,207 --> 00:31:59,681
You need to listen to me.

576
00:31:59,683 --> 00:32:02,405
Stay away from me!

577
00:32:20,958 --> 00:32:23,669
No, no, no. Mon-El!

578
00:32:53,184 --> 00:32:56,104
Father, look around you.

579
00:32:56,236 --> 00:32:59,341
You're hurting people.
Your mind is doing this.

580
00:33:00,377 --> 00:33:04,179
No. You are trying to trick me.

581
00:33:04,307 --> 00:33:06,281
I would never do that.

582
00:33:07,346 --> 00:33:08,912
I love you.

583
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,154
All I want to do is protect you,

584
00:33:13,102 --> 00:33:16,670
as you have tried
to protect me my entire life.

585
00:33:19,196 --> 00:33:20,829
Trust me, Father.

586
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,169
No! No!

587
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,806
Oh, no.

588
00:33:33,877 --> 00:33:35,210
J'onn?

589
00:33:35,683 --> 00:33:37,212
Stay with him.

590
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:04,172
Hey, I'm here. You're okay.

591
00:34:05,567 --> 00:34:07,930
I know how hard it is

592
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:11,046
when everything
we know to be true changes.

593
00:34:11,556 --> 00:34:13,399
But sometimes all we can do

594
00:34:13,478 --> 00:34:15,827
is just accept the way things are,

595
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:18,186
and make the best of that.

596
00:34:26,877 --> 00:34:28,343
Oh, God.

597
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:36,905
J'onn.

598
00:34:37,328 --> 00:34:39,574
The son becomes the father.

599
00:35:00,996 --> 00:35:02,529
Do it.

600
00:35:25,937 --> 00:35:27,370
I know.

601
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:29,672
I don't want you
to worry about me, okay?

602
00:35:31,076 --> 00:35:33,910
I just have to stay in the
hospital for a little while.

603
00:35:37,515 --> 00:35:39,082
I miss you, too.

604
00:35:41,052 --> 00:35:43,353
Yeah, the doctors
are saying it's contagious,

605
00:35:43,446 --> 00:35:45,922
so I don't want you getting sick.

606
00:35:46,001 --> 00:35:48,009
Lena is gonna check up on you,

607
00:35:48,047 --> 00:35:51,593
and I will be home
as soon as I'm better.

608
00:35:51,938 --> 00:35:53,968
I love you so, so much, baby.

609
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,611
Don't worry about Ruby,
I'll take her to...

610
00:36:00,636 --> 00:36:02,302
Don't tell me where she is.

611
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:05,408
You keep her away from me
until I'm cured.

612
00:36:19,557 --> 00:36:21,658
May I speak to you all?

613
00:36:31,569 --> 00:36:33,503
I am sorry

614
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:36,406
for the pain I caused.

615
00:36:36,975 --> 00:36:39,309
I hurt you, all of you.

616
00:36:40,645 --> 00:36:43,046
I was so fearful

617
00:36:43,531 --> 00:36:46,616
of losing control
of what's left of my life,

618
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:50,086
I refused to accept what was happening.

619
00:36:52,257 --> 00:36:55,692
And it nearly cost me

620
00:36:56,261 --> 00:36:59,329
everything I hold dear.

621
00:37:03,568 --> 00:37:07,136
I hoped I would've been able
to protect you all better.

622
00:37:07,388 --> 00:37:09,272
You protect us all the time, J'onn.

623
00:37:09,669 --> 00:37:11,407
Tonight was our turn.

624
00:37:23,121 --> 00:37:25,888
Hey, um, I...

625
00:37:25,955 --> 00:37:28,358
I was gonna leave this here for you.
I didn't think I'd run into you.

626
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,959
You brought me dinner.

627
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,994
Yeah. Um...

628
00:37:32,998 --> 00:37:35,631
Look, I know your work's
really important.

629
00:37:35,633 --> 00:37:39,102
It's saving-the-world important,
but I happen to have a few friends

630
00:37:39,514 --> 00:37:40,636
who make a habit of that.

631
00:37:40,663 --> 00:37:43,539
And I know when they get really
deep into it, they...

632
00:37:43,631 --> 00:37:45,966
They forget to eat, so...

633
00:37:46,394 --> 00:37:47,844
I didn't want that to happen to you.

634
00:37:50,315 --> 00:37:51,881
Well, that is...

635
00:37:53,485 --> 00:37:55,318
incredibly thoughtful.

636
00:37:55,954 --> 00:37:57,653
And I haven't eaten all day.

637
00:37:59,591 --> 00:38:01,024
Well, I'll leave you to it, then.

638
00:38:01,072 --> 00:38:04,494
Well, since there's enough
food here to feed an army,

639
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:07,697
why don't you join me?

640
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:15,071
Listen, James.

641
00:38:16,499 --> 00:38:19,333
There's something between us,
something good.

642
00:38:20,245 --> 00:38:22,179
But in my life, in my work,

643
00:38:22,213 --> 00:38:25,014
there are people
who count on my discretion.

644
00:38:26,384 --> 00:38:29,052
So I won't always be able
to share everything with you.

645
00:38:29,336 --> 00:38:31,754
If you think a secret needs to be kept,

646
00:38:32,424 --> 00:38:34,190
then it needs to be kept.

647
00:38:36,194 --> 00:38:37,760
Well, I appreciate that.

648
00:38:38,563 --> 00:38:40,530
Tell me it's going well, at least?

649
00:38:42,033 --> 00:38:43,433
Not yet.

650
00:38:44,235 --> 00:38:45,568
But it will.

651
00:38:59,117 --> 00:39:01,417
And the student becomes the master.

652
00:39:04,689 --> 00:39:06,289
Can we talk about yesterday?

653
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:09,559
You were whammied by the psychic attack.

654
00:39:09,561 --> 00:39:13,629
Yes, that's true, but I...
The things I said...

655
00:39:15,733 --> 00:39:18,267
I thought I had dealt
with my feelings about us.

656
00:39:21,439 --> 00:39:25,141
But when we were in this episode,

657
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,944
it made me realize that

658
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,380
our relationship was not perfect.

659
00:39:31,875 --> 00:39:35,818
You know, maybe I...
I knew that deep down.

660
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,887
But especially when you were gone,

661
00:39:37,889 --> 00:39:41,791
I was so busy missing you
and romanticizing us...

662
00:39:44,329 --> 00:39:45,928
I do feel

663
00:39:46,664 --> 00:39:49,132
a big weight off my shoulders.

664
00:39:49,589 --> 00:39:52,401
So, in a way, I'm grateful
that it happened.

665
00:39:53,204 --> 00:39:55,138
I'm just really sorry that

666
00:39:56,274 --> 00:39:58,841
it took a Martian attack

667
00:39:59,811 --> 00:40:01,344
to make it come out.

668
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:04,580
And I'm sorry it was so brutal.

669
00:40:05,416 --> 00:40:07,109
You know what, the truth can be brutal.

670
00:40:10,155 --> 00:40:12,889
It's not news to me
that I used to be a jerk.

671
00:40:14,759 --> 00:40:16,492
And I'm... I am sorry.

672
00:40:19,097 --> 00:40:20,596
I'm sorry.

673
00:40:20,999 --> 00:40:22,198
For all of it.

674
00:40:22,716 --> 00:40:26,520
I didn't really grasp
your perspective back then.

675
00:40:26,573 --> 00:40:28,326
Yeah, but still,

676
00:40:28,471 --> 00:40:30,683
I shouldn't have hit you.
I'm sorry for that.

677
00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:32,308
And I'm sorry for...

678
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:37,037
I'm just sorry.

679
00:40:37,615 --> 00:40:38,848
Can we make an agreement?

680
00:40:39,284 --> 00:40:40,883
Yes.

681
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,819
No more apologies.

682
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,860
Do you wanna go be heroes?

683
00:41:23,394 --> 00:41:25,094
Pestilence.

684
