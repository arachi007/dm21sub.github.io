00:38:06,971 --> 00:38:09,906
I have no recollection of
what you're talking about.

702
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:16,646
Well, all you need to
know is that you helped.

703
00:38:17,748 --> 00:38:19,215
J'onn.

704
00:38:20,585 --> 00:38:22,452
Did you know,

705
00:38:22,453 --> 00:38:26,022
if you grind the coffee
beans with the cocoa beans,

706
00:38:26,023 --> 00:38:27,724
you get the most delectable mixture?

707
00:38:28,392 --> 00:38:30,527
I did not know that, no.

708
00:38:31,095 --> 00:38:32,696
I'd like to try it.

709
00:38:34,365 --> 00:38:36,066
- Thank you.
- [CHUCKLES]

710
00:38:41,706 --> 00:38:43,173
That was her.

711
00:38:43,941 --> 00:38:45,508
I saw her face.

712
00:38:45,509 --> 00:38:48,912
It looks like her, I know. I know.

713
00:38:48,913 --> 00:38:51,581
But I promise you,
that's not your mom.

714
00:38:52,483 --> 00:38:54,317
Why should I believe you?

715
00:38:55,319 --> 00:38:57,687
You promised she was gonna be okay.

716
00:38:58,789 --> 00:39:00,090
You're right.

717
00:39:00,958 --> 00:39:03,293
I didn't tell you the truth.

718
00:39:03,294 --> 00:39:07,097
I was hiding it to try and
protect you, and I...

719
00:39:08,532 --> 00:39:11,468
I see now that that was wrong.

720
00:39:12,637 --> 00:39:15,572
I give you my word

721
00:39:15,573 --> 00:39:19,809
that I will do everything within
my power to keep you safe.

722
00:39:21,345 --> 00:39:23,613
And from here on out,

723
00:39:23,614 --> 00:39:26,049
I will always be honest with you.

724
00:39:29,086 --> 00:39:30,520
Is that okay?

725
00:39:37,094 --> 00:39:38,294
[ELEVATOR BELL DINGS]

[EXHALES]

727
00:39:39,764 --> 00:39:42,064
- [LENA] Could you hold the door, please?
- Got it. Ooh.

728
00:39:42,767 --> 00:39:44,701
- Lena.
- Kara.

729
00:39:44,702 --> 00:39:47,037
- You are a sight for sore eyes.
- Hi.

730
00:39:47,038 --> 00:39:48,872
I've been missing you for weeks.

731
00:39:48,873 --> 00:39:50,874
I'm so sorry I haven't been
in touch. It's just...

732
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:53,476
Oh, don't apologize about anything.

733
00:39:53,477 --> 00:39:54,844
What are you doing here?

734
00:39:54,845 --> 00:39:56,513
- Ah, visiting Ruby.
- Oh.

735
00:39:56,514 --> 00:39:58,882
I didn't know what to bring, so
I brought ice cream. [CHUCKLES]

736
00:39:58,883 --> 00:40:01,084
That's a lot of ice cream.

737
00:40:01,085 --> 00:40:02,619
Did you hear what happened?

738
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,854
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

739
00:40:04,855 --> 00:40:06,489
What an awful day for her.

740
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:08,391
Yeah, that's an understatement.

[KARA CLICKS TONGUE]

742
00:40:09,927 --> 00:40:12,195
Alex tells me that you're
helping Supergirl fight Reign.

743
00:40:12,196 --> 00:40:14,931
I'm sure she's so
grateful for your help.

744
00:40:14,932 --> 00:40:18,868
Well... Frankly, I am only working
with Supergirl to save Sam

745
00:40:18,869 --> 00:40:20,209
because I have no other choice.

746
00:40:20,838 --> 00:40:22,172
What do you mean?

747
00:40:22,173 --> 00:40:24,741
Well, it's that old adage.
"Never meet your idols,

748
00:40:24,742 --> 00:40:26,476
it'll only lead to disappointment"?

749
00:40:26,944 --> 00:40:28,478
Oh, yes.

750
00:40:28,479 --> 00:40:31,114
Supergirl's not all truth and
justice like she pretends to be.

751
00:40:31,115 --> 00:40:34,617
You know, she had James break into
L-Corp and search my private vault?

752
00:40:37,121 --> 00:40:40,557
I'm sure she had a really good reason.

753
00:40:40,558 --> 00:40:42,258
Of course, James didn't do it.

754
00:40:42,259 --> 00:40:44,527
- Really?
- Well, no.

755
00:40:44,528 --> 00:40:46,463
We've been dating each
other for months.

756
00:40:46,464 --> 00:40:48,798
He knows me, and he trusts
me, and I trust him.

757
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,034
Supergirl went behind my back,

758
00:40:51,035 --> 00:40:52,936
and used my personal
relationships against me.

759
00:40:52,937 --> 00:40:54,571
That's something my mother would do.

760
00:40:54,572 --> 00:40:56,072
She crossed a line.

761
00:40:57,208 --> 00:40:58,942
I can never trust her again.

762
00:41:01,312 --> 00:41:04,280
I didn't know what flavor Ruby
likes, so I bought every flavor.
