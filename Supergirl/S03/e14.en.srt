1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,119
<i>My name is Kara Zor-El.</i>

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,552
<i>I'm from Krypton.</i>

3
00:00:03,588 --> 00:00:06,022
<i>I'm a refugee on this planet.</i>

4
00:00:06,057 --> 00:00:08,424
<i>I was sent to Earth
to protect my cousin,</i>

5
00:00:08,459 --> 00:00:10,426
<i>but my pod got
knocked off course.</i>

6
00:00:10,461 --> 00:00:13,129
<i>And by the time I got here,
my cousin had already grown up</i>

7
00:00:13,164 --> 00:00:15,631
<i>and become Superman.</i>

8
00:00:16,735 --> 00:00:18,400
<i>I hid who I really was,</i>

9
00:00:18,436 --> 00:00:20,603
<i>until one day
when an accident forced me</i>

10
00:00:20,638 --> 00:00:22,771
<i>to reveal myself
to the world.</i>

11
00:00:22,806 --> 00:00:26,375
<i>To most people, I'm a reporter
at CatCo Worldwide Media,</i>

12
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,645
<i>but in secret, I work with
my adopted sister for the DEO</i>

13
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,880
<i>to protect my city
from alien life</i>

14
00:00:31,915 --> 00:00:34,182
<i>and anyone else
that means to cause it harm.</i>

15
00:00:35,586 --> 00:00:37,585
<i>I am Supergirl.</i>

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,200
<i>Previously on Supergirl...</i>

17
00:00:41,215 --> 00:00:42,853
<i>I really like you, Lena Luthor.</i>

18
00:00:44,898 --> 00:00:46,961
<i>I never thought I'd see you again, Father.</i>

19
00:00:46,962 --> 00:00:49,466
<i>We could make this our home, if you'd like.</i>

20
00:00:49,529 --> 00:00:52,001
<i>I would like that.
Very much.</i>

21
00:00:52,868 --> 00:00:55,723
<i>I haven't been completely honest with you.</i>

22
00:00:55,724 --> 00:00:58,541
<i>It's time for me to tell you the truth
about why we're really here.</i>

23
00:00:59,716 --> 00:01:01,556
<i>The criminal known as Toyman</i>

24
00:01:01,557 --> 00:01:04,914
<i>escaped from maximum security
prison this morning.</i>

25
00:01:05,015 --> 00:01:08,316
<i>I am nothing like you.</i>

26
00:01:08,317 --> 00:01:10,987
<i>Don't underestimate yourself.</i>

27
00:01:13,358 --> 00:01:15,068
I know some of you are scared.

28
00:01:16,736 --> 00:01:19,030
I know some of you
have never done this before.

29
00:01:20,573 --> 00:01:23,576
I know some of you are ready
to get out there and prove yourselves.

30
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:27,205
But just remember why we do this.

31
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:30,333
We do this for the people.

32
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,069
Your turn.

33
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:21,468
Take your shirt off!

34
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:34,314
Aw, who let her pick this song?

35
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,541
Here we go. Come on, Pops! Pops, come on!

36
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:11,226
So, Imra's telepathic?

37
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:14,979
No, it's kinetic.
She moves stuff, not reads minds.

38
00:03:15,438 --> 00:03:17,190
Ah! That's kind of a cool party trick.

39
00:03:17,273 --> 00:03:18,274
Can she move you?

40
00:03:20,693 --> 00:03:22,695
Yeah, she's pretty impressive.

41
00:03:22,779 --> 00:03:24,239
Well, she's gotta be.

42
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,866
You never were into wallflowers.

43
00:03:27,742 --> 00:03:29,702
So, what about you? Huh?

44
00:03:30,745 --> 00:03:33,498
You know, same old same.
You know, work is work.

45
00:03:34,332 --> 00:03:35,750
You seein' anybody?

46
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,586
No, not really.

47
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:42,465
Why are you checking your phone
every 15 seconds then?

48
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:45,844
Fair point.

49
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,304
Yeah, there's somebody,

50
00:03:49,055 --> 00:03:50,431
but we haven't, like, you know,

51
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,767
really figured out
what we're doing yet, so...

52
00:03:52,851 --> 00:03:55,103
- You happy?
- Working on it.

53
00:03:58,273 --> 00:03:59,440
To working on it.

54
00:04:00,108 --> 00:04:01,359
To working on it.

55
00:04:01,484 --> 00:04:02,819
Yes!

56
00:04:02,902 --> 00:04:03,903
Whoo!

57
00:04:03,987 --> 00:04:06,406
I gotta pick a song.
Come on, come on, help me.

58
00:04:08,074 --> 00:04:10,285
See, I told you
you had nothing to worry about.

59
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:13,037
Karaoke is not for the weak.

60
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:17,083
It requires either great courage
or a complete lack of shame.

61
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,585
But I like it.

62
00:04:19,002 --> 00:04:20,211
You do a killer rock star.

63
00:04:20,295 --> 00:04:24,257
I listen to it sometimes
while I look after the apartment.

64
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,550
Oh, yes, yes.

65
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:29,637
You have a stunning apartment,
that I haven't been invited to yet.

66
00:04:30,763 --> 00:04:32,140
Oh! We're still getting it together.

67
00:04:32,223 --> 00:04:33,933
It's been three months.

68
00:04:34,017 --> 00:04:35,935
Okay, I think it's time
for a housewarming party.

69
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:37,937
- I don't think so.
- Yes.

70
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:39,939
The house's temperature
is quite comfortable.

71
00:04:44,277 --> 00:04:45,653
Well, we could do dinner.

72
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:48,198
Lena Luthor's personal phone.

73
00:04:48,281 --> 00:04:50,116
If you have this number
you must be important.

74
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,618
Hey, you, it's me.

75
00:04:51,701 --> 00:04:54,245
I was just checkin' on you,
seeing how busy you are.

76
00:04:54,871 --> 00:04:58,625
Maybe, uh, you're interested
in a hand-delivered dinner tonight?

77
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,251
Give me a call. Bye.

78
00:05:01,836 --> 00:05:05,548
Oh! You know me well.
Yes, that's the one. Here we go.

79
00:05:05,632 --> 00:05:07,425
- Hey. Hey.
- It's gonna be so good. Hi.

80
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:10,345
Hey, can we talk real quick?
It's kind of important.

81
00:05:10,428 --> 00:05:11,846
Yeah, yeah. Of course. In a second.

82
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,932
- Um, Wino's about to melt our faces off.
- Right.

83
00:05:14,015 --> 00:05:16,392
Waitstaff,
yes, you are appreciated.

84
00:05:16,476 --> 00:05:18,061
- Fellow drunks.
- Yeah!

85
00:05:18,144 --> 00:05:20,855
There it is.
Mr. Karaoke Man, if you please.

86
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:22,232
Thank you very much.

87
00:05:22,565 --> 00:05:23,566
Whoo hoo!

88
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:26,569
Whoo!

89
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,155
Uh-huh.

90
00:05:33,493 --> 00:05:34,577
That's Wino's dad.

91
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,831
Guys.

92
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:48,299
I got this. I got this one.

93
00:05:53,471 --> 00:05:56,808
Hey, I'm okay. It's okay. Just...

94
00:05:59,227 --> 00:06:02,230
Do you mind if I just stay out here
for a second with you?

95
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:06,943
Like, he's just gone, right? That's all.

96
00:06:07,277 --> 00:06:09,529
I mean, it's not like
anything's gonna change.

97
00:06:09,612 --> 00:06:12,573
I never talked to him,
I never saw him, I...

98
00:06:13,825 --> 00:06:15,326
That doesn't mean you never felt him.

99
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:17,370
What's that... I'm supposed to be
feeling something, right?

100
00:06:17,453 --> 00:06:20,290
I don't feel anything.

101
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:22,583
I don't think...

102
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:24,002
Um...

103
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:27,213
Just go inside.

104
00:06:32,051 --> 00:06:33,094
I'm not going back in.

105
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,472
Okay.

106
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,630
== Synced & corrected by <font color="#00FFFF">MaxPayne</font> ==

107
00:06:44,397 --> 00:06:49,444
Winslow Schott, Sr.
Was a man with many demons.

108
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:53,156
As we lay him to rest,
we may not celebrate his life,

109
00:06:53,281 --> 00:06:54,741
but we can examine it.

110
00:06:54,824 --> 00:06:57,577
And perhaps forgive
a troubled soul its transgressions.

111
00:06:58,369 --> 00:07:00,747
Would anyone care
to speak on behalf of the deceased?

112
00:07:30,151 --> 00:07:31,402
Winn?

113
00:07:34,697 --> 00:07:36,783
Do you recognize me?
It's been a while.

114
00:07:38,284 --> 00:07:39,619
I know how long it's been.

115
00:07:44,248 --> 00:07:45,583
You just missed him.

116
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,586
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
I never missed him.

117
00:07:50,171 --> 00:07:51,714
I'm not here for him.

118
00:07:53,382 --> 00:07:54,759
Oh, so you're here for me?

119
00:07:56,177 --> 00:07:57,845
Wow, Mom, it's a little late.

120
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,972
You have every right
to be furious with me.

121
00:08:00,056 --> 00:08:01,933
Oh, thank you.
Thank you for your permission.

122
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:03,976
But I am so happy to see you.

123
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,688
Honey, you don't understand it yet,
but we're finally safe.

124
00:08:13,903 --> 00:08:15,279
Everybody, get down!

125
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,796
Bastard always wanted
to go out with a bang.

126
00:08:38,357 --> 00:08:39,692
Okay.

127
00:08:48,367 --> 00:08:49,702
I hate to ask, but I have to.

128
00:08:49,785 --> 00:08:51,203
He's dead, Kara.

129
00:08:51,328 --> 00:08:52,579
- Are you sure?
- He's dead.

130
00:08:52,663 --> 00:08:53,956
Look, I had the warden

131
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:56,625
and two separate medical examiners
sign off on the body.

132
00:08:56,709 --> 00:09:00,629
I had them cross-check his dental records
and his fingerprints, just to be sure.

133
00:09:00,713 --> 00:09:02,840
The dude in the box was my father.

134
00:09:02,923 --> 00:09:04,133
Okay?

135
00:09:04,216 --> 00:09:06,427
So why blow himself up at his own funeral?

136
00:09:06,719 --> 00:09:08,137
Maybe for the headline.

137
00:09:09,138 --> 00:09:11,432
Yeah, "Toyman's last trick."

138
00:09:11,515 --> 00:09:12,808
Sounds about right.

139
00:09:12,891 --> 00:09:14,643
I still think we should run
a full mass spectrometry

140
00:09:14,727 --> 00:09:16,395
on the explosive residue, Winn.

141
00:09:16,478 --> 00:09:17,730
It may tell us who's helping your father.

142
00:09:17,813 --> 00:09:19,440
No one is helping him!

143
00:09:19,523 --> 00:09:21,567
Seriously, he was a crazy person.

144
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,945
Crazy people do crazy things.
Like, oh, I don't know, mass murder.

145
00:09:25,738 --> 00:09:28,782
Well, I'm happy to report
that Mary has a clean bill of health.

146
00:09:30,242 --> 00:09:32,161
She wants to talk to you.

147
00:09:34,413 --> 00:09:36,040
Yeah, she's had 20 years to talk to me.

148
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:41,754
My son, may I borrow
ten of your Earth dollars?

149
00:09:41,837 --> 00:09:44,840
The strike team tackled the deliveryman
when he entered the lobby,

150
00:09:44,923 --> 00:09:46,425
I think I should tip him well.

151
00:09:46,508 --> 00:09:47,676
"Deliveryman"?

152
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,553
But we're having dinner
with Alex and Kara.

153
00:09:49,928 --> 00:09:52,598
That's why I bought a tomato pie.

154
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:55,225
Dad, we're cooking.
We got the ingredients earlier on.

155
00:09:59,146 --> 00:10:03,358
So, we should get to your place ASAP
and get that roast in the oven.

156
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:07,529
Don't worry, tomato pie
is my favorite hors d'oeuvre.

157
00:10:10,783 --> 00:10:11,909
Go, go be with them.

158
00:10:11,992 --> 00:10:13,702
The analysis will take hours,
I'll stay here.

159
00:10:13,786 --> 00:10:14,787
What about the Worldkillers?

160
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,164
Alex has every available agent
looking for them.

161
00:10:17,247 --> 00:10:18,582
Go eat.

162
00:10:18,957 --> 00:10:20,209
All right.

163
00:10:21,043 --> 00:10:22,419
Mon-El.

164
00:10:23,295 --> 00:10:27,007
Hey, Kara... We never talked.

165
00:10:33,514 --> 00:10:36,683
Hey, I owe you an apology.

166
00:10:38,185 --> 00:10:39,436
- For what?
- When we were together

167
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,271
I never really got

168
00:10:41,355 --> 00:10:44,233
how it must have been for you
to find out that I'd been lying.

169
00:10:44,316 --> 00:10:46,610
About being Daxam's prince,
about a lot of stuff.

170
00:10:46,693 --> 00:10:48,278
And I am sorry that I did that to you.

171
00:10:51,156 --> 00:10:53,450
I do really appreciate you saying that.

172
00:10:54,076 --> 00:10:55,285
Of course.

173
00:10:56,286 --> 00:10:57,663
Are you okay?

174
00:11:00,707 --> 00:11:03,418
Yeah, Imra lied to me.

175
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:08,507
About something big

176
00:11:08,966 --> 00:11:10,968
with Legion business,
and Brainy was in on it, too.

177
00:11:11,051 --> 00:11:13,178
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

178
00:11:13,262 --> 00:11:15,305
When your wife conspires
with your best friend...

179
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:16,890
It feels like garbage.

180
00:11:19,351 --> 00:11:22,020
Hey, can we get a drink later?

181
00:11:22,312 --> 00:11:25,023
After all the Winn stuff
is handled, I mean.

182
00:11:25,107 --> 00:11:27,276
There are some things
that I think you should know.

183
00:11:29,403 --> 00:11:31,488
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

184
00:11:31,572 --> 00:11:32,865
What are friends for?

185
00:11:33,323 --> 00:11:34,449
You're the best.

186
00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:36,076
See you later, buddy.

187
00:11:37,494 --> 00:11:38,704
Later, buddy.

188
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:45,919
So, you work with Supergirl.

189
00:11:47,337 --> 00:11:49,798
You should sit up straight, be proud.

190
00:11:50,215 --> 00:11:52,092
You cannot be down here.

191
00:11:52,217 --> 00:11:54,636
Oh, please. If anyone asks,
I'm just looking for the bathroom.

192
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,722
It's around the corner, to the left.
Bye now.

193
00:11:56,847 --> 00:12:00,559
Yeah, I tried that one, but it was
closed for "enhanced interrogation."

194
00:12:01,393 --> 00:12:04,354
Kidding.
Jeez! Just kidding.

195
00:12:05,063 --> 00:12:06,273
You think this is funny?

196
00:12:06,356 --> 00:12:09,193
Oh, a little gallows humor
never killed anybody.

197
00:12:09,484 --> 00:12:12,362
Well, except for the fellows
hanging from the gallows.

198
00:12:12,738 --> 00:12:14,740
What do you want?

199
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,002
I just wanted to see your face, Winn.

200
00:12:27,085 --> 00:12:30,714
I wanted to hear your voice,
I wanted my son back.

201
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:37,888
I have spent 20 years imagining
this moment and now I...

202
00:12:41,058 --> 00:12:42,893
Leaving you, it gutted me.

203
00:12:43,268 --> 00:12:45,354
And I've carried that with me
every day of my life,

204
00:12:45,437 --> 00:12:48,565
but I had to, Winn, because your father...

205
00:12:48,982 --> 00:12:51,026
Oh, no, I'm sorry, let me guess.

206
00:12:51,109 --> 00:12:52,402
He threatened your life.

207
00:12:52,486 --> 00:12:55,572
No, Winn. He threatened yours.

208
00:12:57,366 --> 00:13:03,413
He told me that if I went near you, ever,
that he would kill you.

209
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,707
And when he died, I thought it was safe.

210
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:08,043
But I was wrong. You're still in danger.

211
00:13:08,126 --> 00:13:09,419
I don't believe you.

212
00:13:10,671 --> 00:13:12,714
You saw what your father did,
at his own funeral.

213
00:13:12,798 --> 00:13:15,300
I saw the last grasping
prank of a lunatic.

214
00:13:17,135 --> 00:13:19,972
And now, what I'm hearing is an excuse.

215
00:13:20,681 --> 00:13:22,224
Twenty years in the making.

216
00:13:23,016 --> 00:13:25,435
Hey, I had 20 years to think, too.

217
00:13:27,729 --> 00:13:29,648
You want to know
what I think about the most?

218
00:13:31,233 --> 00:13:32,901
Let me set the scene for you.

219
00:13:34,111 --> 00:13:36,196
It's the night Dad finally snapped.

220
00:13:36,405 --> 00:13:39,449
And I'm sitting in the police station,
freezing cold,

221
00:13:39,533 --> 00:13:40,617
because I'm in my pajamas.

222
00:13:40,701 --> 00:13:43,412
When the police came
and picked me up from home,

223
00:13:43,495 --> 00:13:44,705
I was asleep.

224
00:13:44,788 --> 00:13:46,873
Remember? In bed. Alone.

225
00:13:48,417 --> 00:13:52,546
And the nice officer, he drapes
the coat over my shoulders.

226
00:13:53,171 --> 00:13:54,339
I feel a little better.

227
00:13:54,631 --> 00:13:56,174
So I'm sitting there,

228
00:13:56,508 --> 00:14:01,138
and my cold little feet are dangling
in the air, and I'm waiting.

229
00:14:03,015 --> 00:14:08,520
I'm waiting for my mom to pick me up.

230
00:14:10,522 --> 00:14:13,442
'Cause they said that they called you.
Yeah.

231
00:14:14,192 --> 00:14:16,737
Yeah, they said
it was just gonna be like an hour,

232
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,573
and then they'd explain everything.

233
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,159
And then it was two hours.

234
00:14:22,784 --> 00:14:25,078
And then it was the next morning.

235
00:14:28,749 --> 00:14:30,500
When I lie in bed at night,

236
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,712
staring up at the ceiling,
unable to sleep,

237
00:14:33,837 --> 00:14:37,507
I'm not wondering why Dad finally,
suddenly snapped.

238
00:14:37,591 --> 00:14:40,135
No, that doesn't haunt me.
What haunts me is you.

239
00:14:40,844 --> 00:14:46,308
You, who left me,
when I needed you the most.

240
00:14:46,391 --> 00:14:50,270
With no explanation, no goodbye.

241
00:14:51,396 --> 00:14:52,689
I'm so sorry.

242
00:14:52,773 --> 00:14:54,191
I don't care anymore.

243
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,152
And I don't need your excuses.

244
00:14:57,486 --> 00:14:59,571
You wanna keep me safe?
Great.

245
00:15:00,363 --> 00:15:02,991
You know what you should do?
Leave again!

246
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,417
Something's happening.

247
00:15:17,422 --> 00:15:20,675
- What the hell is that?
- It's a message. For me.

248
00:15:25,555 --> 00:15:26,932
Is that a wicked witch?

249
00:15:27,391 --> 00:15:31,061
No. Is it flying monkeys?

250
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:42,359
I'll take the big one,
you take the little one.

251
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,236
I am so happy I don't work here.

252
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:50,534
Quickly, hide. Under the desks.

253
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,411
- Come on!
- What are you doing?

254
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:55,372
- We've gotta stay down...
- This is my job, Mom!

255
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:26,528
Oh!

256
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:27,821
You came for me.

257
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,119
Mom!

258
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:37,581
Get away from him, you nightmare.

259
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:06,693
This is your job?

260
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:08,528
This is?

261
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:13,408
Okay. Well, keep me posted.

262
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:14,743
Problem?

263
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:16,870
Oh, there was a minor kerfuffle,

264
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:19,831
but no one was hurt
and Kara's got it handled,

265
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:21,375
so you just keep relaxing.

266
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:26,004
So, some of that
old time rock 'n' roll, huh?

267
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:29,091
That was an epic karaoke performance.

268
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:32,052
Indeed.

269
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,137
But a problematic genre.

270
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,515
- Been on the Internet?
- Yes.

271
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:40,394
Many of the pioneers of rock 'n' roll
were humans of color

272
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:44,064
who did not receive the fame or fortune
their white counterparts did.

273
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:48,610
Have you faced many challenges
in your human form since you've been here?

274
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:49,569
No.

275
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:52,364
My relative isolation
has its silver linings.

276
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:56,868
My son has found goodhearted friends
in his time on this planet.

277
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:58,662
You all treat me like family.

278
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:02,249
You've chosen to live
as a black man in America,

279
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:05,585
which is a harder existence,
in and of itself.

280
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:08,130
- Why?
- You know, I was...

281
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:10,674
I was forced to become Hank Henshaw
out of desperation,

282
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,718
but now I choose this face.

283
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,177
I like it.

284
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:15,846
And I wouldn't want to live in a world

285
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,889
where I need to change
the color of my skin to feel safe,

286
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:21,601
to feel seen,
to feel like I'm not a target.

287
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,562
I'd rather change the world.

288
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:27,899
And whatever my son's fight may be,
I choose it as well.

289
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:30,319
And I have your backs.

290
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:31,695
- Let's drink to that.
- Cheers.

291
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:39,328
Alex, you need more...

292
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,752
Wine, Dad.

293
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:50,297
Your English is fantastic,
don't worry about the occasional slip-up.

294
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,174
I'll go get some more wine.

295
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,678
I hope you still have room.
J'onn has made chocolate pie for dessert.

296
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:00,432
Well, your mom's right,

297
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:02,976
somebody is definitely
helping your dad out.

298
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:06,355
I just honestly just wish she would leave.

299
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:09,441
Like, who the hell
does she think she is anyway, huh?

300
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:12,944
Like, she just doesn't get to walk
back into my life after 20 years.

301
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:15,614
I did not get a say in her walking out,

302
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:18,408
I definitely get a say
in her walking back in.

303
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:22,537
- It's a fair point.
- Yeah.

304
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:26,708
You think that I should?

305
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:31,797
No, dude, no. Don't think that I should.

306
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,257
Brother, it doesn't matter what I think,
it matters what you need.

307
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:39,721
You know what, even if, even if
my dad had threatened to kill me,

308
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:41,598
she could have done
a thousand other things.

309
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,350
Gone to the police, the FBI.

310
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:46,436
No. Instead, she decided to abandon me.

311
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:49,022
And you know what, she has to
deal with the consequences.

312
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:52,609
You know, if she'd have stayed

313
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:56,154
then, maybe, you know,
we could have had a...

314
00:19:57,072 --> 00:19:59,491
You know, a great relationship.

315
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:00,659
Let me stop you right there.

316
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:04,788
That is a dangerous thought exercise
designed purely just to piss you off.

317
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:18,969
When my dad died,

318
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:24,683
my mom did everything
for me and my sister.

319
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:27,227
She worked night and day,
she busted her ass,

320
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:29,771
and I still blamed her.

321
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,733
Because she was the only one there.

322
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,112
And that was rough.

323
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:40,532
We got over it though.

324
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:43,535
You know, took a long time,
and a lot of forgiveness,

325
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:46,872
and me taking responsibility
for my part in that.

326
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:50,709
You can't change what happened,

327
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:52,627
but she's here now.

328
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,881
It's up to you
what you wanna do with that.

329
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,688
I always knew
he was brilliant and capable,

330
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,858
but I worried when I left that
he'd go the same way his dad did.

331
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:16,485
He worried about that, too.

332
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:20,363
I should have been here to tell him
that he and his father were worlds apart.

333
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,741
Did his friends tell him?

334
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:24,034
We did.

335
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:26,578
- Thank you for that.
- Well, it was easy.

336
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:33,460
He doesn't always get the credit,
but he keeps us going around here.

337
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:39,049
He's always the one with some crazy idea
that no one else would possibly dream of.

338
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,219
My son works with Supergirl.

339
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:45,931
It's just such a relief.
He saves lives.

340
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:49,392
I just wish he'd let me tell him
how proud I am of him.

341
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:52,270
I think he will.

342
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:53,730
Eventually.

343
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:56,733
Sorry about the mess.

344
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,444
Oh, this? This is...
That's not your fault.

345
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:04,199
Can I ask,
when it comes to your day-to-day,

346
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:06,535
on a scale of one to ten,

347
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:09,412
how big of a pain in the ass
are flying monkeys?

348
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:10,539
Maybe a two.

349
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:11,790
Oh!

350
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:14,000
- Does that make you feel better?
- Yes.

351
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:15,627
- Very much so.
- Good.

352
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:21,925
Pie in three minutes.

353
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,385
Okay.

354
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:30,600
Well, thank you for having me tonight.
The place looks wonderful.

355
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,227
Uh, the pleasure was mine.

356
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:35,647
You mean a great deal to J'onn.

357
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,816
Well, he's very important to me, too.

358
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:40,277
I know we are new friends,

359
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,028
but I hope, in time,

360
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:46,491
that we can be the kind of family
you and J'onn have become.

361
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:48,868
That would be lovely.

362
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:51,288
I have always wanted a granddaughter.

363
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:56,793
You mean besides K'hym and T'ania?

364
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,128
Who?

365
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:00,422
Your granddaughters.

366
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:11,016
My grandmother was a music lover as well.

367
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:13,351
Especially later in her life.

368
00:23:13,602 --> 00:23:15,937
It just seemed to always
give her that extra spark.

369
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:19,316
Even when she started forgetting things.

370
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,109
Like, little things at first.

371
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:25,280
It was just words, you know,
why she'd walk into a room,

372
00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:27,365
and eventually,

373
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:29,117
people.

374
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:33,955
I think you might be
exhibiting similar symptoms.

375
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:35,165
Please don't tell him.

376
00:23:35,874 --> 00:23:39,377
- You already knew?
- On Mars we called it Za-alet.

377
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:43,256
Translated roughly,
it means "decay of memory."

378
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:45,717
Dementia.

379
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,802
I am losing myself.

380
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:51,348
As it progresses, you're gonna need help.

381
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:53,266
He has helped me enough.

382
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,226
No, you're gonna need more than that.

383
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,979
Because you could hurt yourself or others.

384
00:23:58,605 --> 00:23:59,647
You have to tell him.

385
00:23:59,731 --> 00:24:00,815
He just got me back,

386
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:04,402
I can't ask him
to watch me disappear inch by inch.

387
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:05,487
It's too cruel.

388
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,113
Well, that could happen,
no matter what.

389
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:11,785
So, the sooner you tell him
the sooner he can get help.

390
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:17,082
I'm sorry, Myr'nn, but if he asks me,
I mean, I don't think I could lie to him.

391
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:18,875
You will say nothing.

392
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:21,378
He is my son.

393
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:23,505
And I choose how best
to protect him, not you.

394
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:25,757
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean...
- Get out.

395
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:28,301
Get out of my house.

396
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:30,303
Dad, everything okay out there?

397
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:36,059
What happened?

398
00:24:42,567 --> 00:24:43,610
Ah!

399
00:24:44,903 --> 00:24:47,405
That is an angry monkey corpse.

400
00:24:47,488 --> 00:24:49,532
I was hoping to access
this thing's inner workings,

401
00:24:49,616 --> 00:24:51,534
but it's like a game of Operation.

402
00:24:51,618 --> 00:24:55,079
Every time I get close to cracking it,
it just zaps me.

403
00:24:55,204 --> 00:24:57,165
Can I try?
I love Operation.

404
00:24:57,248 --> 00:24:59,375
I'm not sure if you noticed,

405
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:02,587
but it's, like, a top-secret
government facility in here.

406
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,130
Oh, nobody cares.

407
00:25:04,213 --> 00:25:06,466
Are you paid enough to care?
No, of course not.

408
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:09,260
- You should unionize, by the way.
- Mom, that's...

409
00:25:09,344 --> 00:25:11,804
Did I ever tell you
I was once your father's apprentice?

410
00:25:12,847 --> 00:25:14,223
I thought you two met in Ivy Town.

411
00:25:14,307 --> 00:25:16,809
We were both students, yes,
but that's not where we met.

412
00:25:16,893 --> 00:25:21,773
I kept the books at the local toy store
and your father was the genius stock-boy.

413
00:25:21,856 --> 00:25:25,902
And he taught me about
the math in the machine.

414
00:25:25,985 --> 00:25:28,404
One and one is two,
it's simple, it's elegant.

415
00:25:28,488 --> 00:25:30,281
It's clean.

416
00:25:30,365 --> 00:25:32,283
Just like a wind-up toy.

417
00:25:32,992 --> 00:25:36,663
Your father's mind was a wind-up toy.
I know what made it tick.

418
00:25:37,664 --> 00:25:38,831
So then you knew how to stop him

419
00:25:38,915 --> 00:25:41,876
from going crazy and
killing a bunch of people.

420
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:50,343
Um, do you remember when I took you
to Disneyland when you were nine?

421
00:25:50,426 --> 00:25:51,552
Do I remember?

422
00:25:51,636 --> 00:25:53,012
Yeah, we drove overnight,

423
00:25:53,096 --> 00:25:55,306
'cause you wanted to be there
the second it opened.

424
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,059
And then we get into a car accident
at 2:00 a.m. in the morning

425
00:25:58,142 --> 00:26:00,103
and Dad has to come and pick us up
and takes us home.

426
00:26:00,186 --> 00:26:02,355
We never actually went to Disneyland.

427
00:26:02,438 --> 00:26:05,274
No. We were never going there.

428
00:26:06,192 --> 00:26:08,903
We were going to a domestic-abuse shelter.

429
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,115
And he ran us off the road.

430
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:17,829
Stole a car, sped down the highway,
ran us into a ditch.

431
00:26:17,954 --> 00:26:21,833
You sat dazed in the backseat
with a concussion,

432
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:25,128
and he and I had it out
on the shoulder of the interstate.

433
00:26:25,253 --> 00:26:28,840
That's the night that he threatened
to kill you, his only son,

434
00:26:28,923 --> 00:26:30,883
just to hurt me.

435
00:26:35,054 --> 00:26:40,768
Your father didn't just go to bed normal
and wake up the next morning a monster.

436
00:26:40,852 --> 00:26:43,438
He was paranoid, he was controlling,

437
00:26:45,314 --> 00:26:46,441
he was mean.

438
00:26:48,526 --> 00:26:49,736
I never saw it.

439
00:26:49,819 --> 00:26:51,237
I didn't want you to.

440
00:26:53,156 --> 00:26:55,742
And I'm sorry, Winn, I'm sorry that...

441
00:26:56,242 --> 00:26:58,494
I couldn't get us out
from under his shadow.

442
00:26:59,078 --> 00:27:00,621
That I couldn't save you.

443
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:02,874
That's not on you.

444
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:06,711
Maybe not, but the last
20 years, those were.

445
00:27:07,336 --> 00:27:08,755
And you were right about that.

446
00:27:09,589 --> 00:27:12,175
But I just wanted you to understand why.

447
00:27:17,388 --> 00:27:18,598
Alex?

448
00:27:19,515 --> 00:27:21,559
- What happened?
- What do you mean?

449
00:27:22,977 --> 00:27:25,938
Did he offend you?

450
00:27:26,314 --> 00:27:28,024
- Say something?
- No. Of course not.

451
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:29,942
No, your father is wonderful.

452
00:27:30,026 --> 00:27:31,527
So then, what went so wrong?

453
00:27:32,904 --> 00:27:34,781
You know, we were having
such a lovely time.

454
00:27:35,323 --> 00:27:39,452
And now my father has completely
closed himself off for some reason.

455
00:27:40,995 --> 00:27:41,996
Why?

456
00:27:43,998 --> 00:27:48,419
You're gonna have to talk to him about it.
It's not my place. I'm sorry.

457
00:27:49,462 --> 00:27:53,883
But, for the record,
I had a lovely time, too.

458
00:27:57,345 --> 00:27:59,097
If you
have this number you must be important.

459
00:27:59,514 --> 00:28:00,807
Yo, it's me again.

460
00:28:01,349 --> 00:28:03,392
I talked to your assistant, he said
you hadn't checked in in a few days

461
00:28:03,476 --> 00:28:04,936
so I just wanted to...

462
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:07,688
Just give me a call when you can.

463
00:28:09,107 --> 00:28:11,526
Any luck on figuring out
who's behind the Toyman attacks?

464
00:28:11,609 --> 00:28:15,071
No, but we've discovered a thousand
ways how not to make a flying monkey.

465
00:28:15,154 --> 00:28:18,074
And also a few ways
to make better flying monkeys.

466
00:28:18,157 --> 00:28:20,952
Though the wiring on these
is amateurish at best.

467
00:28:21,035 --> 00:28:24,539
Alas, we are no closer to finding out
who actually built them.

468
00:28:28,584 --> 00:28:29,585
I could use a break.

469
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:32,004
I'm gonna head downstairs,
rest for a little bit.

470
00:29:06,581 --> 00:29:11,669
I don't know why you hate me or my son,
but it stops, right here.

471
00:29:13,462 --> 00:29:15,381
I'm pointing a gun at you, by the way.

472
00:29:15,506 --> 00:29:17,717
In case that's a thing
you'd be interested in knowing.

473
00:29:19,302 --> 00:29:22,513
A gun. That's a dangerous toy.

474
00:29:24,807 --> 00:29:26,350
But mine are worse.

475
00:29:33,848 --> 00:29:35,266
Have you guys seen my mom?

476
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:37,894
I thought you two were putting
Humpty Dumpty together again.

477
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:38,895
No, she's gone.

478
00:29:38,978 --> 00:29:40,980
So is the side panel
from the monkey's gear chamber.

479
00:29:43,608 --> 00:29:47,278
I have your mother,
but you can trade your life for hers.

480
00:29:47,361 --> 00:29:50,740
She's hanging around at the old
Wiggins Game Company factory.

481
00:29:50,823 --> 00:29:53,367
But hurry, Junior, the pressure is on.

482
00:29:53,451 --> 00:29:55,286
Winn, don't come here.

483
00:29:55,703 --> 00:29:57,705
- I'll go.
- Me, too.

484
00:29:57,997 --> 00:29:59,290
Not without me.

485
00:29:59,499 --> 00:30:00,750
That's exactly what she wants.

486
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:01,959
I've spent my entire life

487
00:30:02,043 --> 00:30:03,961
trying to fight off
the part of me that's like my dad,

488
00:30:04,045 --> 00:30:06,380
but now, now I can use it.
Let's go.

489
00:30:08,716 --> 00:30:11,802
Hey, Buffalo Bill,
why are you doing this to us?

490
00:30:11,886 --> 00:30:13,346
"Us"? Who's "us"?

491
00:30:13,429 --> 00:30:16,307
The shrew wife who wouldn't
let her husband have any fun?

492
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:20,269
The son who never wrote,
never called, never visited

493
00:30:20,353 --> 00:30:23,397
his lonely, ailing father in prison?

494
00:30:23,981 --> 00:30:27,693
You really think
you're a pair worthy of sympathy?

495
00:30:27,985 --> 00:30:29,779
- Or mercy?
- You knew my husband.

496
00:30:29,862 --> 00:30:32,198
I worked maintenance at the penitentiary.

497
00:30:32,281 --> 00:30:36,244
He was a brilliant, dedicated man.

498
00:30:36,327 --> 00:30:40,915
A once-in-a-lifetime mind.
He graced me with everything he knew.

499
00:30:41,666 --> 00:30:44,919
And, in exchange,
I promised to carry out his wishes.

500
00:30:45,628 --> 00:30:47,213
- Even after he died.
- Oh.

501
00:30:47,463 --> 00:30:48,881
So you're his patsy.

502
00:30:48,965 --> 00:30:52,301
His apprentice. His protege.

503
00:30:52,969 --> 00:30:56,013
And the executor of his final wishes.

504
00:30:56,389 --> 00:30:58,975
To punish you, if you broke the rules.

505
00:31:02,395 --> 00:31:04,105
I'm gonna kill your son.

506
00:31:05,147 --> 00:31:08,526
I'm gonna make you watch,
just like Winslow wanted.

507
00:31:10,194 --> 00:31:11,988
Then I'm gonna kill you, too.

508
00:31:16,617 --> 00:31:17,910
Any ideas?

509
00:31:17,994 --> 00:31:19,537
She was in that claw apparatus.

510
00:31:19,662 --> 00:31:22,290
- Suspended from above.
- We'll find her.

511
00:31:26,877 --> 00:31:28,087
What is that?

512
00:31:28,212 --> 00:31:29,338
It's a plane.

513
00:31:29,422 --> 00:31:31,424
No, it's not, it's a bomb.

514
00:31:38,014 --> 00:31:39,307
Go find Mary.

515
00:31:48,316 --> 00:31:53,154
Welcome, welcome to the
Willard Walter Wiggins Game Company.

516
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,828
We got a thing on our 12.

517
00:32:00,911 --> 00:32:03,331
- That's our six.
- I'm very stressed right now.

518
00:32:05,916 --> 00:32:07,251
Literal Hot Wheels.

519
00:32:14,342 --> 00:32:17,094
So glad Junior brought his friends.

520
00:32:17,928 --> 00:32:19,221
There she is.

521
00:32:23,225 --> 00:32:27,855
Heat vision, freeze breath,
and so many points of articulation,

522
00:32:27,938 --> 00:32:29,398
I think I'll keep you.

523
00:32:34,278 --> 00:32:38,074
It's so rare to find a vintage
superhero in mint condition.

524
00:32:38,532 --> 00:32:39,825
Supergirl.

525
00:33:00,721 --> 00:33:01,806
Mom.

526
00:33:04,225 --> 00:33:05,476
Go get her.

527
00:33:07,728 --> 00:33:08,771
I got these.

528
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:16,654
Kara, I've got you.

529
00:33:19,156 --> 00:33:20,282
You okay?

530
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,541
Ooh!

531
00:33:51,439 --> 00:33:52,815
Cloth magic.

532
00:33:55,276 --> 00:33:56,527
Mom.

533
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:58,237
Turn around and leave right now.

534
00:34:01,031 --> 00:34:02,158
I'm here to rescue you.

535
00:34:02,241 --> 00:34:03,576
Don't Luke Skywalker me.

536
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:06,996
This crazy woman is trying to kill you.
Don't give her the chance.

537
00:34:08,247 --> 00:34:12,918
Well, if it isn't Toyman Jr.
Barreling headlong into danger.

538
00:34:13,377 --> 00:34:15,796
I see your father
left you none of his brains.

539
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,006
Oh, really?

540
00:34:17,089 --> 00:34:20,301
'Cause I see that he left you
none of his showmanship.

541
00:34:20,843 --> 00:34:22,887
What, after all this
you're just gonna shoot us?

542
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:25,014
Most important thing
your father taught me,

543
00:34:25,097 --> 00:34:26,182
stick the landing.

544
00:34:26,307 --> 00:34:29,852
Really? Because what I got
was, "More is more."

545
00:34:41,572 --> 00:34:42,615
Winn!

546
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:49,663
Your dad taught me this one, too.

547
00:34:50,247 --> 00:34:51,582
Did he teach you this?

548
00:35:00,758 --> 00:35:02,009
Childish things.

549
00:35:02,092 --> 00:35:03,010
Thank you, Winn.

550
00:35:03,093 --> 00:35:05,513
We've got to get that cleaned out
right now before it gets infected.

551
00:35:05,596 --> 00:35:07,264
When was your last tetanus shot?

552
00:35:07,681 --> 00:35:10,351
Mom, recently. I am very cautious.

553
00:35:11,435 --> 00:35:12,686
Oh!

554
00:35:17,149 --> 00:35:18,275
Hey.

555
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:30,167
This is unfortunate.

556
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,460
Oh, white-boy rock.

557
00:35:31,543 --> 00:35:34,004
Hey, rookie mistake, bud. It's...

558
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,299
I'm so proud of you.

559
00:35:38,175 --> 00:35:40,010
What, for shaming my friends?

560
00:35:40,093 --> 00:35:42,888
No, you came out from the darkness,

561
00:35:42,971 --> 00:35:45,640
you forged
an incredible life for yourself.

562
00:35:45,724 --> 00:35:49,811
I've spent so many years worrying
about what had become of you,

563
00:35:49,895 --> 00:35:52,314
what the loss of your father,
what the loss of me did to you,

564
00:35:52,397 --> 00:35:56,735
and you have not only survived,
you have excelled.

565
00:35:56,818 --> 00:35:59,529
And I couldn't be happier.

566
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:02,991
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

567
00:36:05,327 --> 00:36:06,703
And now I can leave.

568
00:36:08,997 --> 00:36:10,290
You don't need me.

569
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:16,505
No. I mean, no, I don't,
but, look, you're here. Okay?

570
00:36:17,714 --> 00:36:19,466
And I'd like us to get to know each other.

571
00:36:20,967 --> 00:36:22,469
I'd like that too, Winn.

572
00:36:23,887 --> 00:36:25,680
Hey, and besides, you can't leave now.

573
00:36:25,764 --> 00:36:26,765
Why's that?

574
00:36:27,265 --> 00:36:30,477
Because I am signing us up for a song.

575
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,229
Winn, please.

576
00:36:36,066 --> 00:36:37,442
So, how bad was that?

577
00:36:37,526 --> 00:36:39,194
That was... Thank you.

578
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:44,032
I would just say maybe you should
sing Kansas for yourself

579
00:36:44,115 --> 00:36:45,742
and not for other people.

580
00:36:45,825 --> 00:36:47,202
Yeah, that's good advice.

581
00:36:49,663 --> 00:36:52,457
Yeah, well, I only wanted
to talk to you anyway, so...

582
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:54,251
Hey.

583
00:36:54,543 --> 00:36:55,752
Uh...

584
00:36:56,836 --> 00:37:00,423
I'm really sorry you're hurting,
that really sucks,

585
00:37:01,466 --> 00:37:03,426
but I can't be the one
to talk to you about this.

586
00:37:05,345 --> 00:37:08,223
It's something you and Imra have to
deal with between the two of you,

587
00:37:08,306 --> 00:37:11,935
and I don't think she'd like
you talking to me about her.

588
00:37:12,018 --> 00:37:16,731
And, frankly,
it doesn't really feel great for me.

589
00:37:17,732 --> 00:37:20,652
So... That's that.

590
00:37:23,196 --> 00:37:24,489
I totally get it.

591
00:37:26,241 --> 00:37:27,284
Really?

592
00:37:27,742 --> 00:37:30,954
But, just so you know,
I wasn't actually gonna talk about Imra.

593
00:37:31,037 --> 00:37:32,163
I mean, not about my feelings.

594
00:37:32,247 --> 00:37:34,457
But I felt like
you needed to know what she did,

595
00:37:34,541 --> 00:37:37,460
and why she did it,
'cause it directly affects you.

596
00:37:40,547 --> 00:37:42,382
The Legion didn't land here by accident.

597
00:37:42,465 --> 00:37:44,968
Wait, I thought you hit a disruption.

598
00:37:45,051 --> 00:37:48,013
Yeah, we did, but Brainy
and Imra hit it intentionally.

599
00:37:49,097 --> 00:37:50,307
And they hid the real mission from me

600
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:53,518
because they didn't trust that
I'd wanna come back to this time.

601
00:37:54,394 --> 00:37:55,562
What's the mission?

602
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,648
Well, the third Worldkiller,

603
00:37:59,357 --> 00:38:01,109
the one you haven't found yet,
Pestilence...

604
00:38:02,569 --> 00:38:05,280
In 1,000 years she evolves into Blight.

605
00:38:09,826 --> 00:38:12,329
Yeah, so if we can find her now,
in this time,

606
00:38:13,288 --> 00:38:15,790
then we can save everyone,
today and in the future.

607
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:20,211
And, look, we have a common
enemy now, so we can work together.

608
00:38:20,295 --> 00:38:22,422
But our common enemy
has been your enemy for years,

609
00:38:22,505 --> 00:38:25,425
so I got a lot to learn from you.

610
00:38:26,301 --> 00:38:31,014
Like, wait a sec, what was that
back there with the T. Rex?

611
00:38:31,097 --> 00:38:32,349
Cape tricks.

612
00:38:32,641 --> 00:38:34,059
"Cape tricks"?

613
00:38:34,142 --> 00:38:35,518
My old Legion uniform had one.

614
00:38:35,602 --> 00:38:37,520
Well, I've been fighting
with a cape for three years

615
00:38:37,604 --> 00:38:39,189
and all it seems to do is get in the way.

616
00:38:39,272 --> 00:38:41,358
I can help with that, if you want.

617
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,527
I'd like that.

618
00:38:47,614 --> 00:38:49,282
Why haven't you worn your old suit?

619
00:38:49,366 --> 00:38:51,701
Yeah, it got damaged on Rimbor.
It's a long story.

620
00:38:52,452 --> 00:38:54,621
Well, I know someone
who could fix it, if you want.

621
00:39:00,877 --> 00:39:04,339
Ghost pepper mac and cheese
with a side of jalapeño peppers.

622
00:39:04,881 --> 00:39:06,675
My favorite.

623
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,677
Yeah, I know.

624
00:39:10,553 --> 00:39:14,057
So, I spoke to Alex.

625
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:18,687
She wanted me to know
that she had a lovely time.

626
00:39:21,189 --> 00:39:23,149
I hope whatever happened between you two,

627
00:39:23,233 --> 00:39:24,693
there are no hard feelings.

628
00:39:32,033 --> 00:39:33,118
Dad, what is it?

629
00:39:33,702 --> 00:39:34,994
What is it?

630
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,163
I'm sorry, J'onn.

631
00:39:38,832 --> 00:39:40,125
I'm so sorry.

632
00:39:42,043 --> 00:39:43,545
What's up? What's wrong?

633
00:39:44,462 --> 00:39:45,922
I want you to have a life.

634
00:39:46,589 --> 00:39:48,675
I don't want to
keep you from your friends.

635
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:51,261
Keep you home, keep you locked away.

636
00:39:51,344 --> 00:39:53,680
- You won't, you won't.
- But I will!

637
00:39:57,767 --> 00:39:59,936
I must tell you something.

638
00:40:20,415 --> 00:40:22,751
They're a lot worse
than I thought they'd be, though.

639
00:40:52,155 --> 00:40:53,490
- Lena.
- James.

640
00:40:54,282 --> 00:40:55,283
I'm so sorry.

641
00:40:57,118 --> 00:40:58,620
I've been trying to reach you
for a couple of days now.

642
00:40:58,703 --> 00:41:01,915
I know, it's just, I didn't realize
how massive the workload would be

643
00:41:01,998 --> 00:41:03,208
back at L-Corp.

644
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:04,542
Sam and I have been swamped.

645
00:41:04,626 --> 00:41:06,753
You guys have been
at work this entire time?

646
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:10,131
Holed up in a conference room,
pulling all-nighters like it's a startup.

647
00:41:10,507 --> 00:41:12,050
It's okay, though, the work's important.

648
00:41:12,133 --> 00:41:14,385
Just, time got away from us.

649
00:41:14,803 --> 00:41:16,012
I've been worried about you.

650
00:41:16,095 --> 00:41:17,597
There's nothing to worry about.

651
00:41:18,932 --> 00:41:20,391
Everything's fine.

652
