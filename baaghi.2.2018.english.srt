1
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:52,313
That's the car,

2
00:03:55,461 --> 00:03:56,156
go

3
00:04:08,688 --> 00:04:10,125
Get out of the car

4
00:04:10,218 --> 00:04:11,008
Get out.

5
00:04:17,977 --> 00:04:18,758
hey

6
00:04:19,102 --> 00:04:19,672
No no

7
00:04:19,697 --> 00:04:21,008
 Hold on...

8
00:04:22,055 --> 00:04:22,688
hey

9
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:04,359
Two months later...

10
00:05:17,024 --> 00:05:20,312
I see you going for two months.

11
00:05:21,326 --> 00:05:22,428
Any question?

12
00:05:24,492 --> 00:05:27,085
I have not seen any faces that come here so unhappily

13
00:05:29,923 --> 00:05:31,040
I am alone ..

14
00:05:32,162 --> 00:05:34,123
Nobody will help.

15
00:05:34,265 --> 00:05:36,031
I thought that this would help me, too ..

16
00:05:37,948 --> 00:05:40,190
But I do not feel like listening here

17
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,292
No son ..

18
00:05:41,317 --> 00:05:42,440
There's no such thing.

19
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:43,869
God

20
00:05:44,383 --> 00:05:46,227
Everyone is listening.

21
00:05:54,571 --> 00:05:55,250
One time, son

22
00:05:56,491 --> 00:05:57,688
 Only once

23
00:05:58,172 --> 00:05:59,992
confess your confession.

24
00:06:01,836 --> 00:06:05,446
Certainly God sends someone for you...

25
00:06:39,783 --> 00:06:42,736
Ranveer Singh in this operation... killing three people...

26
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:43,892
 Explanations Have anything?

27
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,564
Sir, this is in accordance with military law.

28
00:06:47,127 --> 00:06:48,166
No offensive damage

29
00:06:48,838 --> 00:06:51,043
The three terrorists were civilians as civilians.

30
00:06:54,726 --> 00:06:56,578
The Army's giants...
This is our box

31
00:06:56,664 --> 00:06:59,561
Our path is stronger than your bullet

32
00:07:01,174 --> 00:07:02,533
There is not a problem until then ..

33
00:07:02,682 --> 00:07:03,745
What about the rest?

34
00:07:13,008 --> 00:07:14,758
There is a violation of human rights. This is sir ..

35
00:07:18,594 --> 00:07:20,914
A terrorist is being held hostage ..

36
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:22,500
coming out.

37
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:28,725
A man is going to kill himself to get out of the way

38
00:07:29,124 --> 00:07:30,272
Where's the law?

39
00:07:30,545 --> 00:07:31,733
It's not without methods, sir

40
00:07:36,097 --> 00:07:36,675
  Sir

41
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,800
Officer who went with him for this.

42
00:07:39,268 --> 00:07:40,636
We suspend his activity

43
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:43,206
You decide yourself, sir.

44
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:46,370
Ranjit
- Sir

45
00:07:48,378 --> 00:07:49,777
Captain Ranwher Pheap Singh

46
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:51,706
I also took my decision ..

47
00:07:51,878 --> 00:07:53,339
You, with your reunion team

48
00:07:53,535 --> 00:07:55,074
I will meet at the Training Grounds

49
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,378
And before I come...

50
00:07:56,682 --> 00:07:59,917
You must be 25 miles [5 km] away.

51
00:08:00,074 --> 00:08:01,628
Your time has just begun.

52
00:08:02,245 --> 00:08:02,855
Start.

53
00:08:03,472 --> 00:08:04,316
Ji Hind Sire ..

54
00:08:10,893 --> 00:08:11,440
Sir ..

55
00:08:25,877 --> 00:08:28,089
Your nurse saved your job from ninety nine

56
00:08:28,114 --> 00:08:28,831
Is it fun?

57
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,566
It did not crad your phone ..
Take a look

58
00:08:36,581 --> 00:08:38,253
We do not have the right to light our weapons

59
00:08:38,941 --> 00:08:39,699
How can you do it?

60
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,910
They will say yes.
- <i> Hi Roni ..</i>

61
00:08:43,062 --> 00:08:44,062
<i>Neha ..</i>

62
00:08:44,183 --> 00:08:45,769
<i>Call four years later.</i>

63
00:08:46,206 --> 00:08:48,386
<i>I'm not sure if you use the old one or not.</i>

64
00:08:49,285 --> 00:08:51,245
<i>But if you can hear me...
Call me again.</i>

65
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,283
<i>989223583</i>

66
00:08:57,734 --> 00:08:58,523
Hey, Ronnie...

67
00:08:59,266 --> 00:09:00,469
Forget that girl.

68
00:09:01,547 --> 00:09:02,790
I know your situation.

69
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,461
Since then, there has been no connection since


70
00:09:06,172 --> 00:09:07,352
Do not know what you want.

71
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:38,194
leave...

72
00:09:38,655 --> 00:09:39,890
yesterday saved a disciplinary inquiry ..

73
00:09:40,491 --> 00:09:41,679
Do you need a vacation today?

74
00:09:41,788 --> 00:09:42,280
Yes, sir

75
00:09:42,687 --> 00:09:43,420
Why should I go ..?

76
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:44,319
Personal work, sir ..

77
00:09:44,702 --> 00:09:46,015
I think kids will understand you

78
00:09:46,444 --> 00:09:48,046
Military does not have any personal task.

79
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,577
Not for four years left, sir.

80
00:09:51,811 --> 00:09:52,826
Give me seven days, sir, for me.

81
00:09:53,171 --> 00:09:55,015
Four years from these mountains

82
00:09:55,576 --> 00:09:57,740
People who do not know how to deal with people

83
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,171
Let me handle it

84
00:10:03,788 --> 00:10:04,452
Commando...

85
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,296
7 days for you...

86
00:10:08,015 --> 00:10:09,515
On the first day of the first rays of the sun...... on the eighth day......

87
00:10:09,796 --> 00:10:10,421
Unit...

88
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,741
Barracks...

89
00:10:12,108 --> 00:10:12,866
 Uniform...

90
00:10:13,272 --> 00:10:14,257
And I...

91
00:10:15,152 --> 00:10:16,580
You will be hoping...

92
00:10:16,605 --> 00:10:17,690
Thank you, sir

93
00:10:19,924 --> 00:10:21,190
 Jai Hindi sir...

94
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,260
neha

95
00:10:47,674 --> 00:10:48,947
Hi simmi

96
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,703
Neha please listen

97
00:10:50,728 --> 00:10:51,674
What happened?

98
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:53,010
Ronnie's number was found...

99
00:10:53,134 --> 00:10:53,868
What is Ronnie?

100
00:10:53,893 --> 00:10:54,572
Ronnie...

101
00:10:55,173 --> 00:10:56,955
Ronnie... Oh, no...

102
00:10:57,064 --> 00:10:58,791
That's the one that did the school games

103
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,541
Yes, the slambol champion...

104
00:11:00,986 --> 00:11:03,018
What about him?
- What about him? Come on.

105
00:11:04,385 --> 00:11:04,822
see

106
00:11:05,455 --> 00:11:06,940
Oh, is that it?

107
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,635
Yes, there is a guy in the basketball ball.

108
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,096
Let's phone.

109
00:11:10,121 --> 00:11:11,166
Thank you.
Congratulations

110
00:11:11,376 --> 00:11:12,337
Are you crazy?

111
00:11:12,362 --> 00:11:14,038
Do you call him?
He does not even know if we know him -

112
00:11:18,229 --> 00:11:19,979
Yah .. Hey, Ronnie

113
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,455
Who is this?

114
00:11:21,721 --> 00:11:24,049
how nice you are...
proper bones

115
00:11:24,074 --> 00:11:24,979
How did you make it?

116
00:11:29,118 --> 00:11:29,868
fuck'd up

117
00:11:29,893 --> 00:11:31,096
go go go

118
00:11:31,979 --> 00:11:33,929
Can I know who I'm talking to?

119
00:11:34,188 --> 00:11:35,211
Saved

120
00:11:35,656 --> 00:11:38,632
Do not talk to us if we do not?

121
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:40,899
How do you say without the name?

122
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:42,586
What do you say ..?

123
00:11:42,974 --> 00:11:46,989
How girls are talking about you How can I not speak to you?

124
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,342
What did the girls say about you...?

125
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:52,765
How do you know about me?

126
00:11:52,983 --> 00:11:54,569
What is it you're about to do? - Hey Mr. Michael Jordan.

127
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:56,491
In your toy basketball basket, you are shown:

128
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:58,483
I'm not like girls ...
- Shut your mouth

129
00:11:58,508 --> 00:12:00,327
So... Call... I did not...

130
00:12:00,811 --> 00:12:03,272
This hello .. Call me back I did. My friend

Are u Happy now?

132
00:12:05,265 --> 00:12:07,858
However... fortunate enough to talk to me right now

133
00:12:08,108 --> 00:12:11,092
Or I did not meet a guy for more than two words with me.

134
00:12:11,554 --> 00:12:14,132
Why did it happen...
Are you so ugly?

135
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:15,903
Ugly?

136
00:12:16,051 --> 00:12:18,082
I'll see if I can see a photo...

137
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:19,457
I will  Of course ..?

138
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,582
Well, let's try and... turn around  What did you say?

139
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,223
what?

140
00:12:45,185 --> 00:12:46,654
Listen

141
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:51,974
I'll let you stay on...

142
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:53,349
I know ..

143
00:12:54,036 --> 00:12:56,373
I got a boyfriend
Sheeker his name

144
00:12:56,846 --> 00:12:58,072
A well-developed man...

145
00:12:58,775 --> 00:13:00,954
You will meet him...
- Hmm... Hmm... Hmm...

146
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:02,604
How are you doing Hmm...?

147
00:13:02,792 --> 00:13:05,338
Hey, he came looking for you

148
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,784
I really like you.

149
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,486
Do you know...There are three reasons to love each other

150
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,470
The first mentality

151
00:13:14,768 --> 00:13:15,604
Just a little madness

152
00:13:17,042 --> 00:13:17,823
What do you think ..

153
00:13:18,534 --> 00:13:20,714
The rest of you try to be more fun than her  He's gotta stay there like that.

154
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:22,549
I'm keenly drawn ..

155
00:13:22,917 --> 00:13:24,503


156
00:13:25,073 --> 00:13:25,776
Nice.

157
00:13:26,354 --> 00:13:27,331
The second is emotional...

158
00:13:27,698 --> 00:13:28,510
your heart ..

159
00:13:29,073 --> 00:13:31,839
your friend stopped college coming
_ Why pay no money...

160
00:13:32,401 --> 00:13:33,432
You paid for his fee...

161
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:35,667
She was given a college scholarship

162
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,815
The third thing is the physical nature

163
00:13:42,135 --> 00:13:43,128
 your smile...

164
00:13:44,446 --> 00:13:45,946
Maybe you still have not seen it so beautiful...

165
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:49,885
That... you... you....... You have done your shame...

166
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:52,526
Fear and anger when you collected...

167
00:13:52,605 --> 00:13:54,049
I like it a lot...

168
00:13:55,284 --> 00:13:56,667
But I do not like you...

169
00:13:57,477 --> 00:13:59,361
you... you must be his father ..?

170
00:13:59,395 --> 00:14:01,510
Goodbye Sir
- Hello!

171
00:14:01,783 --> 00:14:02,814
Hello

172
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:03,729
Nice to meet you

173
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,166
I went running over the headroom and went...
I did not see you...

174
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,018
I will go  a real car...

175
00:14:10,318 --> 00:14:11,482
nice car...

176
00:14:13,615 --> 00:14:14,646


177
00:14:14,725 --> 00:14:16,287
I am... I'm Ronnie

178
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,459
Be careful of these people...

179
00:14:20,584 --> 00:14:21,271
go to

180
00:14:40,951 --> 00:14:42,037
Ask now.

181
00:14:42,224 --> 00:14:44,099
I have three reasons for reluctant people

182
00:14:44,295 --> 00:14:46,201
One... arrogance

183
00:14:46,349 --> 00:14:48,411
two. More people. Readers who read the hell

184
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,724
Third...

185
00:14:49,896 --> 00:14:51,459
You came after me...

186
00:14:51,943 --> 00:14:54,092
I can not see those people...

187
00:14:55,371 --> 00:14:56,675
Good things are yours...

188
00:14:57,339 --> 00:14:58,519
Straight say what...

189
00:14:58,793 --> 00:14:59,558
I would like to...

190
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,526

Is this an upgraded version?

What happened?

229
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:37,737
It feels scary ..

230
00:18:38,658 --> 00:18:39,815
At age seven ..

231
00:18:40,057 --> 00:18:41,120
 told a boy...

232
00:18:41,643 --> 00:18:43,393
He set up my best friend and I kissed him

233
00:18:45,831 --> 00:18:47,377
 I know it's ridiculous.

234
00:18:48,408 --> 00:18:49,878
It's been said to my mom...

235
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:51,424
It went away ..

236
00:18:54,295 --> 00:18:55,122
Let's do this  Remember love and forget...

237
00:18:55,264 --> 00:18:56,311
What did you say?

00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:57,232
I mean ..

240
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,115


241
00:19:00,522 --> 00:19:01,811

00:19:02,366 --> 00:19:03,225

00:19:08,155 --> 00:19:10,303
And I want to make my love everyday you...

246

00:20:26,663 --> 00:20:27,381

259
00:21:01,288 --> 00:21:02,389
I am in the army now

260
00:21:02,577 --> 00:21:03,170
Then

261
00:21:03,585 --> 00:21:04,975
What happened to Slamball?

262
00:21:05,272 --> 00:21:06,444
You like it very much

263
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,514
= The ball of bullion before four years...

264
00:21:12,881 --> 00:21:13,897
So...

265
00:21:14,412 --> 00:21:15,279
Are you married?

266
00:21:15,327 --> 00:21:17,865

280
00:22:05,513 --> 00:22:07,161
I like it somehow.

281
00:22:08,866 --> 00:22:10,691
I went to school for about an hour.

282
00:22:13,553 --> 00:22:14,874
<i>The first day of schooling.

283

<i>But my mom got so much...

In a minute my whole life has changed.

298
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:05,154
I do not know what they want.

299
00:23:06,979 --> 00:23:08,883
Help me find my daughter.

300
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:11,243

I need a car.

307
00:26:04,532 --> 00:26:06,266
If you come to Goa, you will not forget two things.

308
00:26:06,949 --> 00:26:08,550
The beer bar of every bend...

309
00:26:08,836 --> 00:26:10,430
UMC car that ride on a road...

310
00:26:10,915 --> 00:26:11,469
Huh?

311
00:26:11,766 --> 00:26:12,906
But first the ID is for security.

312
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,133
Seven...

313
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:25,368
The whole world is safe for the entire country

314
00:26:25,516 --> 00:26:27,938
 Hey, chotu, take it soon.

315
00:26:28,469 --> 00:26:30,680
Military officers have a great honor in my heart.

316
00:26:31,305 --> 00:26:32,485
A lot ..

317
00:26:33,149 --> 00:26:34,100
Here...

318
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:36,735
We kill each other on the streets at the same time...

319
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,289
among those you are like people...

320
00:26:39,187 --> 00:26:40,734
Give their life for the country

321
00:26:41,102 --> 00:26:41,961
Only once

322
00:26:42,641 --> 00:26:44,274
once  you are so lazy...

323
00:26:44,649 --> 00:26:46,016
The answer is on the basis of the answer  Huh?

324
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:46,891
Huh?

325
00:26:47,735 --> 00:26:48,946
why you come to the gova?

326
00:26:49,156 --> 00:26:50,960
personal use
- for personal use

327
00:26:51,672 --> 00:26:53,537
 I have come here for a personal purpose too.

328
00:26:53,907 --> 00:26:55,079
Fifteen years ago.

329
00:26:55,422 --> 00:26:57,594
Then I found this Russian cutlery.

330
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:58,719
Hey, Marion.

331
00:26:59,391 --> 00:27:00,430
Marion ..

332
00:27:00,555 --> 00:27:01,838
Both meals are made.

333
00:27:02,141 --> 00:27:03,383
The children are looking after it.

334
00:27:03,742 --> 00:27:04,774
Umsan ba... milk.

335
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,336
She did not say anything.

336
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:08,961
The noise has gone a lot.

337
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,102
Dope.

338
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:14,211
I felt the high volume of that silent guy ..

339
00:27:16,031 --> 00:27:18,430
Life's too much out of life.

340
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:20,333
all my strengths were lost.

341
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,770
I just missed you.

342
00:27:22,716 --> 00:27:23,724
You said it.

343
00:27:24,138 --> 00:27:25,505
You always stand for me,

344
00:27:25,701 --> 00:27:27,138
<i>In life, whatever happens...</i>

345
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:28,857
<i>I'll be with you every day.</i>

346
00:27:28,943 --> 00:27:30,841
Today I need you Ronnie.

347
00:27:31,013 --> 00:27:33,396
The time we were together was that life was the most beautiful thing

348
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,154
It will always be remembered.

349
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:37,247
Ria is my everything ..

350
00:27:37,466 --> 00:27:38,755
I need your help

351
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,895
In the past two months nobody helped me.

352
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,826
I'm not selfish ..
I'm helpless with Ronnie.

353
00:27:43,068 --> 00:27:45,935
<i>Did you see my daughter, Raiya? - I did not see Ma'am

354
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,958
Did my daughter see Riya
- We do not know</i>

355
00:27:48,154 --> 00:27:50,974
<i>I do not know. Really? I'm sorry to get this call.</i>

356
00:27:52,052 --> 00:27:53,349
What's the status of Shaker...?

357
00:27:53,458 --> 00:27:55,208
Sheikren is too crazy.

358
00:27:55,753 --> 00:27:57,119
<i>= Shakeer to join Roya.</i>

359
00:27:57,339 --> 00:27:58,964
<i>Where is my daughter? Where is Riah?</i>

360
00:28:00,307 --> 00:28:01,245
Uhah, police...?

361
00:28:01,401 --> 00:28:03,344
The police...
- <i> Sir Sir Sir</i>

362
00:28:03,824 --> 00:28:04,726
<i>What happened to my complaint?</i>

363
00:28:04,751 --> 00:28:06,844
<i>Madam, we do not have any information.</i>

364
00:28:06,869 --> 00:28:09,430
One day I come home... that they say...

365
00:28:09,586 --> 00:28:11,234
<i>Madam has been investigating for two months.</i>

366
00:28:11,259 --> 00:28:12,297
<i>No hints were found.</i>

367
00:28:12,322 --> 00:28:15,133
<i>Your case was closed. Sign here.
- What nonsense?</i>

368
00:28:15,719 --> 00:28:16,867
Can I see them?

369
00:28:24,563 --> 00:28:26,875
Ratod. Why was this file here?

370
00:28:28,445 --> 00:28:31,711
This is inside.
It fixes the last bit ..
- All right, sir.

371
00:28:32,547 --> 00:28:34,750
Hane .. Nihimah...
Come on.

372
00:28:34,914 --> 00:28:37,203
Go in and you...
_ Are you in good health?

373
00:28:38,507 --> 00:28:39,617
IP
- Yes, sir

374
00:28:39,642 --> 00:28:41,177
Get Ma'am file.
- Come on, sir.

375
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:42,851
For months, look, madam.

376
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,524
No you did not sign it.

377
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,575
Sign it now. Madam, finish the case.

378
00:28:47,912 --> 00:28:49,513
How will you do the case?

379
00:28:49,732 --> 00:28:51,654
For two months it is investigated.

380
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:54,021
Nothing was found.

381
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:58,934
And you have nothing for us...

382
00:28:58,959 --> 00:29:00,176
You did not give it.

383
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:02,668
Yes, sir

384
00:29:10,575 --> 00:29:12,012
Hey.

385
00:29:13,497 --> 00:29:14,715
Did you think that the library came?

386
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,512
ah?

387
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:16,551
Who is you?

388
00:29:17,731 --> 00:29:18,575
A friend ..

389
00:29:19,637 --> 00:29:20,817
Which national friend is madam?

390
00:29:21,598 --> 00:29:22,754
A family friend ..

391
00:29:23,825 --> 00:29:26,488
What kind of speech did you say to your friend.

392
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,442
This is not a story.

393
00:29:28,723 --> 00:29:30,012
This also has to be there.

394
00:29:30,239 --> 00:29:31,887
My boyfriend's missing. You're not doing anything.

395
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,965
Is it evidence that comes coming from the wind?

396
00:29:37,184 --> 00:29:39,207
It's too expensive. This dog.

397
00:29:40,395 --> 00:29:41,973
You stop the sound of the dog.

398
00:29:42,075 --> 00:29:43,512
I want to come?
- Okay, sir

399
00:29:45,401 --> 00:29:46,128
Ma'am...

400
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,676
We can not do anything purely.

401
00:29:49,457 --> 00:29:51,512
But God will surely listen to your request.

402
00:29:52,981 --> 00:29:54,262
Try it.

403
00:29:59,192 --> 00:30:00,168
Go back.

404
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,872
She's forgotten where she is.

405
00:30:02,356 --> 00:30:03,637
I told you to go back.

406
00:30:03,918 --> 00:30:04,926
Stop him.

407
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,970
Or make it a side...

408
00:30:07,995 --> 00:30:09,275
He'll be hit.

409
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:28,674
You shook my hand, too? B ..

410
00:31:45,912 --> 00:31:48,197
Ronnie

411
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:09,027
Ma'am, if you stay here, the questions will increase.

412
00:32:09,573 --> 00:32:12,034
But my friend is in. So...

413
00:32:12,953 --> 00:32:14,310
I put my hand up to the police. She's madam.

414
00:32:14,418 --> 00:32:15,951
But the situation is now under control.

415
00:32:23,646 --> 00:32:25,658
Morning will release her tomorrow morning.

416
00:32:25,683 --> 00:32:27,581
Please go...
- Are you sure?

417
00:32:27,606 --> 00:32:28,948
Yes, inevitably.

418
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:44,545
Sir...

419
00:32:45,207 --> 00:32:46,502
Sir, look here, sir.

420
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,459
Whoops, who the hell are you?

421
00:32:56,484 --> 00:32:58,060
Sir, he's a soldier.

422
00:32:58,085 --> 00:33:00,530
What? - Yes Sir
- Did not say before, because man ..?

423
00:33:01,116 --> 00:33:02,190
Huh?

424
00:33:02,591 --> 00:33:04,905
All right, we've bothered you so much

425
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,171
You were tortured

426
00:33:08,343 --> 00:33:10,375
I find it encouraging.

427
00:33:10,443 --> 00:33:13,256
This is not your borders

428
00:33:13,597 --> 00:33:15,042
this is my area

429
00:33:15,433 --> 00:33:17,767
No, no one rescued you, did you understand?

430
00:33:22,513 --> 00:33:24,886
Hey, get up DIG sir is here.

431
00:33:34,203 --> 00:33:35,443
DIG sir, come on, hurry up.

432
00:33:35,468 --> 00:33:37,757
Dude, come on, DIG.

433
00:33:46,848 --> 00:33:49,788
Ranver... Kapoor... who's...

434
00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:51,341
Sir, this actor.

435
00:33:51,376 --> 00:33:52,699
The one in the picture.

436
00:33:53,011 --> 00:33:54,427
Sir A Ranwir Pratap Singh  There you go... bring it.
-

437
00:33:54,623 --> 00:33:56,439
 All right, sir.

438
00:33:57,972 --> 00:34:00,775
Sir, DIG sir is talking.

439
00:34:00,941 --> 00:34:02,240
DIG sir right now?

440
00:34:04,603 --> 00:34:06,205
Get this one unclean.

441
00:34:10,209 --> 00:34:11,381
Then you are

442
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,949
Ranweer Pratap Singh.

443
00:34:13,974 --> 00:34:14,847
hmmm

444
00:34:15,873 --> 00:34:16,830
Yes, sir

445
00:34:17,396 --> 00:34:18,480
Do you know Ranwir?

446
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:21,527
My older brother was used to

447
00:34:22,502 --> 00:34:23,901
I will be a doctor

448
00:34:24,784 --> 00:34:26,386
I do not get up early in the morning

449
00:34:27,214 --> 00:34:29,214
At night we have to go to emergency patients.

450
00:34:29,556 --> 00:34:31,282
So I did not become a doctor.

451
00:34:32,415 --> 00:34:33,673
But the case is.

452
00:34:34,025 --> 00:34:36,712
This is a nightmare for people to find out.

453
00:34:37,329 --> 00:34:38,704
It will not sleep.

454
00:34:39,968 --> 00:34:40,694
This time.?

455
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,021
Do not you know how to respect the idol?

456
00:34:46,436 --> 00:34:47,264
Know Sir

457
00:34:47,647 --> 00:34:48,936
So, what did a police officer do with his hand?

458
00:34:49,475 --> 00:34:50,577
He forgot his job.

459
00:34:51,647 --> 00:34:52,639
I reminded you.

460
00:34:52,975 --> 00:34:54,608
Who are you?

461
00:34:55,618 --> 00:34:56,586
Is that God?

462
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:57,735
Hmm ..?

463
00:34:58,183 --> 00:35:01,967
According to Section 475 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

464
00:35:03,493 --> 00:35:07,865
Do not you know that you can not arrest an army officer?

465
00:35:08,952 --> 00:35:10,014
Are you an army?

466
00:35:10,948 --> 00:35:11,987
This time out of office.

467
00:35:12,772 --> 00:35:14,765
An official who is absent from duty is an identical to a civilian

468
00:35:15,876 --> 00:35:16,876
That's what I know.

469
00:35:18,043 --> 00:35:18,738
Give a second.

470
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,451
This is Ranjith ..

471
00:35:25,031 --> 00:35:26,688
Did you go? Yes. Yes, I went.

472
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,565
This is your commando ..

473
00:35:29,892 --> 00:35:31,454
He explains military rules.

474
00:35:31,611 --> 00:35:32,900
Is there before you?

475
00:35:33,275 --> 00:35:34,259
You call yourself

476
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:36,415
Your Colonel

477
00:35:38,259 --> 00:35:39,353
Ji Hindi sir ..
- Jay Hind

478
00:35:39,728 --> 00:35:40,947


479
00:35:41,798 --> 00:35:43,673
Ronnie. Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.

480
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:46,650
I'm happy about the DIG of Shergar who was a friend of my badge.

481
00:35:46,892 --> 00:35:48,626
Or stay in the prison cell all night long.

482
00:35:48,681 --> 00:35:50,408
Sir, sir. I can explain everything.

483
00:35:50,463 --> 00:35:51,985
Ronnie, you explain it to yourself.

484
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:54,759
Tomorrow at seven o'clock.

485
00:35:54,854 --> 00:35:56,665
I want you all an explanation.

486
00:35:57,103 --> 00:35:58,353
Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.

487
00:36:02,322 --> 00:36:03,837
You are like his best guy.

488
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:05,618
Have you heard a story?

489
00:36:06,017 --> 00:36:07,072
It's a garlic rot.

490
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,908
The whole stomach is caring ..

491
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,236
Is not it ..?

492
00:36:13,943 --> 00:36:15,443
Go to go  Sir.

493
00:36:16,054 --> 00:36:16,882
Ask this boy.

494
00:36:19,616 --> 00:36:20,484


495
00:36:22,023 --> 00:36:23,304
My brother used to say.

496
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:25,952
Once a soldier...

497
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:28,444
Always be a soldier...

498
00:36:29,273 --> 00:36:29,905
After that ..

499
00:36:31,382 --> 00:36:32,726
Be Responsible.

500
00:36:36,515 --> 00:36:39,116
Because Sallier is going so early...

501
00:36:39,554 --> 00:36:40,741
War on the border?

502
00:36:41,663 --> 00:36:42,905
Tell us if you like...

503
00:36:44,967 --> 00:36:46,381
I think the war is very violent  Not inside or inside of yours A girl's girlfriend?

504
00:36:47,476 --> 00:36:50,109
oh, well ..

505
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,241


506
00:36:56,491 --> 00:36:57,405


507
00:36:57,773 --> 00:36:58,749
I understood ..

508
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:01,444
When a heart warms the heart...

509
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,569
Always ask the heart.

510
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:06,047
What the brain says... is normal

511
00:37:07,498 --> 00:37:09,225
But the heart's... right.

512
00:37:09,467 --> 00:37:11,474
<i>Ria is my everything.</i>

513
00:37:11,631 --> 00:37:13,896
<i>I need your help, Ronnie.</i>

514
00:37:14,685 --> 00:37:16,364
<i>Can I help my daughter?</i>

515
00:37:26,224 --> 00:37:27,615
<i>Whats in life...  I am with you every day ..</i>

516
00:37:27,911 --> 00:37:29,154
<i>Turn Usman on Cars.</i>

517
00:37:30,154 --> 00:37:31,224
B...?

518
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:32,098
Turn the car around. Go to the hotel.

519
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,107


520
00:37:35,247 --> 00:37:38,131
It looks like the heart, the brain is overwhelming (like)

521
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,998
Yes, what should I do? ..

522
00:37:46,029 --> 00:37:49,021
Two months ago your school boy was kidnapped An abduction?

523
00:37:49,131 --> 00:37:50,130
When?
- on Feb 7th

524
00:37:50,341 --> 00:37:52,599


525
00:37:52,818 --> 00:37:56,036
No, no such thing happened. You got a bad news.

526
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,818
Actually, a family friend told me.

527
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:01,498
A police investigation was made about it.

528
00:38:01,523 --> 00:38:03,795
No, your child was never here.

529
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:06,131
See his photo...
Ria is his name

530
00:38:07,162 --> 00:38:09,404
Ria SanGuccar ..
- Shark boy.

531
00:38:10,029 --> 00:38:12,138
But this boy was not a schoolboy in our school = How to seize it from here?

532
00:38:12,327 --> 00:38:14,818


533
00:38:14,843 --> 00:38:17,326
There is no child in here.

534
00:38:30,818 --> 00:38:33,412
Huh... Huh... Hah...
It's a great story, Shukla G .. Say, uh... and say ..

00:38:33,717 --> 00:38:35,662

You are... you...

00:38:41,365 --> 00:38:42,661
So... what do you want me to do?

00:38:42,795 --> 00:38:44,318
Do you know anything about it? Who are you?

541
00:38:44,826 --> 00:38:46,763
Is it a cop?
- Family, sir

00:39:11,425 --> 00:39:14,016

00:39:14,041 --> 00:39:16,064
I'm really sorry
- It's ok not to say.

550
00:39:16,923 --> 00:39:18,110
Ria went to school.

551
00:39:18,751 --> 00:39:20,939
Princeton says it did not look like

552
00:39:21,603 --> 00:39:24,134
There was not a girl named Raiya.
- They usually say it like that.

553
00:39:25,103 --> 00:39:26,728
appeal to this case.

554
00:39:27,454 --> 00:39:29,860
But I can understand him
Anyone who does that  If you have a dispute, do you have a family, OK? Does Cole come in?

555
00:39:30,345 --> 00:39:32,790


556
00:39:32,815 --> 00:39:33,892


557
00:39:34,212 --> 00:39:36,360
No... nothing happened.

558
00:39:37,064 --> 00:39:38,540
What does Shaker say about this?

559
00:39:39,134 --> 00:39:41,759
I see my condition and she is all hiding in her heart.

560
00:39:42,001 --> 00:39:43,025
Can I talk to him?

561
00:39:43,493 --> 00:39:44,400
Schaiker about us...

562
00:39:46,603 --> 00:39:48,087
you do not know anything about yourself

563
00:39:51,696 --> 00:39:54,634
Can you know who you were kidnapped?
- They were masked.

564
00:39:55,961 --> 00:39:57,016
There will be some way.

565
00:39:58,064 --> 00:40:00,900
Ronnie: I would like to ask for help.

566
00:40:01,493 --> 00:40:02,040
Well.

567
00:40:03,368 --> 00:40:04,735
Can I have Riauge more pictures for me?

568
00:40:05,657 --> 00:40:07,407
No, I...

569
00:40:08,009 --> 00:40:09,884
What did you mean...?

570
00:40:10,259 --> 00:40:11,134
Somewhere.?

571
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:13,790
Social networks, phone, friends.

572
00:40:14,126 --> 00:40:15,267
All friends are luxury.

573
00:40:15,292 --> 00:40:16,705
Social networking is something far apart from me Shaker does not like this.

574
00:40:17,556 --> 00:40:20,071


575
00:40:20,267 --> 00:40:23,400
You're saying that your house, your daughter's one photo?

576
00:40:27,267 --> 00:40:27,962
Sunny.

577
00:40:28,665 --> 00:40:29,469
Sunny Shaker's brother.
Ronnie, you go quickly.

578
00:40:30,446 --> 00:40:32,782


579
00:40:32,807 --> 00:40:33,969
- Ronnie. Move it. - What's wrong?

580
00:40:33,994 --> 00:40:35,900
Shaker's brother will know a big problem.

581
00:40:36,087 --> 00:40:37,305
Please go
- so you can say

582
00:40:37,332 --> 00:40:38,543
Please try to understand me, Ronnie.

583
00:40:38,571 --> 00:40:41,344
Big problem here
Please go quickly.

584
00:41:14,327 --> 00:41:14,944
Hey...

585
00:41:15,898 --> 00:41:16,671
Baby. (Baby) I told you, Barbie Anybody there?

586
00:41:17,655 --> 00:41:18,709


587
00:41:21,428 --> 00:41:22,249


588
00:41:24,413 --> 00:41:25,960
Who's at home?

589
00:41:30,382 --> 00:41:31,905
Brother said to keep an eye on you  You know I'd like to be here.

590
00:41:33,929 --> 00:41:36,655


591
00:41:40,882 --> 00:41:41,874
I will make fun of you

592
00:41:42,155 --> 00:41:43,234
They are making fun of.

593
00:41:45,398 --> 00:41:45,780
Do you know?

594
00:41:46,726 --> 00:41:47,734
Last night ..

595
00:41:49,264 --> 00:41:50,218
A little more.

596
00:41:50,921 --> 00:41:53,319
With Russian friends with music up to four in the morning...

597
00:41:53,624 --> 00:41:54,562
Dance danced.

598
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,780
Dance daddy  Dance is great.

599
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:56,952
Dance is great.

600
00:41:56,977 --> 00:41:58,249


601
00:42:03,284 --> 00:42:04,652
You should do me something If she finds out Shaker....  It will be very angry.
- Really?

602
00:42:05,191 --> 00:42:06,902
What happened to Shaker?

603
00:42:07,238 --> 00:42:08,926
What the hell is this?

604
00:42:11,058 --> 00:42:12,566


605
00:43:12,107 --> 00:43:13,013


606
00:43:22,076 --> 00:43:22,583
Uh...

607
00:43:23,771 --> 00:43:24,318
paws...

608
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,356
Sunny...

609
00:43:27,904 --> 00:43:28,966
It'll be here immediately.

610
00:43:29,037 --> 00:43:29,896
Get more  Shut up.
- Not right?

611
00:43:29,921 --> 00:43:31,599
Son of Me, now.

612
00:43:31,826 --> 00:43:33,044
OK.

613
00:43:34,966 --> 00:43:36,076


614
00:43:36,771 --> 00:43:38,099
Good good.

615
00:43:39,051 --> 00:43:39,762
go.

616
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:47,091
But I'm coming back.

617
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,177
Who is it?

618
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:05,380
My cousin.

619
00:44:05,818 --> 00:44:06,826
Full powdery.

620
00:44:06,851 --> 00:44:08,568
Shakir tells something when she says.

621
00:44:08,701 --> 00:44:09,513
She's a little girl.

622
00:44:10,521 --> 00:44:11,802
I need her number and address.

623
00:44:13,482 --> 00:44:14,146
Do not worry.

624
00:44:14,677 --> 00:44:16,146
The problem is solved, not to stun it.

625
00:44:25,208 --> 00:44:26,505
Sorry, sir ..
- Yes.

626
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:27,685
Are you here?

627
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,074
Yes why?

628
00:44:29,193 --> 00:44:31,701
Do you know the spouse and his wife, Nahu?

629
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:33,576
Is Songkockers?

630
00:44:33,747 --> 00:44:34,802
Sixth floor
- Yes, sir  Their daughter ..

631
00:44:34,827 --> 00:44:36,270
When did you see him finally?

632
00:44:36,787 --> 00:44:38,263
Did she have a daughter?

633
00:44:39,263 --> 00:44:40,450


634
00:44:41,146 --> 00:44:43,794
Actually, there's one apartment on one floor.

635
00:44:44,201 --> 00:44:45,669
So we will never know each other.

636
00:44:46,458 --> 00:44:47,927
Not one. Who are you?

637
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,201
Yes, so.

638
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,974
Have you seen this, Sunny?

639
00:45:06,458 --> 00:45:07,169
Speak  Your daughter's daughter was abducted two months ago.

640
00:45:07,598 --> 00:45:09,325


641
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:11,201
I want to know about it.

642
00:45:11,388 --> 00:45:12,763
Who are you, cop?

643
00:45:15,926 --> 00:45:17,794
Uh, I'm reading a newspaper editor.

644
00:45:17,927 --> 00:45:19,427
So what?
- I am my principal ..

645
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:28,200
Oh, Ronnie.

646
00:45:28,365 --> 00:45:30,896
How long I am chasing after
Who am I...

647
00:45:30,982 --> 00:45:32,278
= සූки
- How are you?

648
00:45:34,434 --> 00:45:36,270
What happened?
- Did you get your hair?

649
00:45:36,701 --> 00:45:37,583
I am in the army.

650
00:45:37,951 --> 00:45:39,279
Actually .. it's been cut down.

651
00:45:39,935 --> 00:45:40,201
Yes.

652
00:45:40,927 --> 00:45:41,833
My appearance is?

653
00:45:42,826 --> 00:45:43,841
Mmm...

654
00:45:44,044 --> 00:45:46,248
You are exactly like a bridegroom.

655
00:45:46,357 --> 00:45:47,638
exactly what the friend said.

656
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:49,450
This is your friend's marriage today.

657
00:45:49,475 --> 00:45:50,474
Keep it safe

658
00:45:51,481 --> 00:45:52,661
That's where the bride is.

659
00:45:52,686 --> 00:45:53,669
Your name.

660
00:45:55,286 --> 00:45:56,216
You're wasting ..

661
00:45:56,241 --> 00:45:57,810
Hey, Warren  O .. or .. Ronnie...

662
00:45:58,013 --> 00:45:59,787
How are you?

663
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,528
How did Ronnie?

664
00:46:02,568 --> 00:46:03,644


665
00:46:05,169 --> 00:46:06,520
You remember a lot ..
How are you?

666
00:46:07,326 --> 00:46:08,637
Let's have fun.

667
00:46:08,662 --> 00:46:11,388
This is Suki's sneezing.

668
00:46:11,943 --> 00:46:14,230
You gotta get married for a few moments.

669
00:46:14,255 --> 00:46:16,895
It was each getting married, Ronnie and Neha.

670
00:46:17,013 --> 00:46:18,395
So suki.

671
00:46:18,755 --> 00:46:20,200
No, no. I was just trying to tell you Ronnie, we'll be right back  I'm not coming anywhere.

672
00:46:20,225 --> 00:46:22,240
<b> I love Nehda, sir. </ b>

673
00:46:22,265 --> 00:46:23,562
Say the word  Neha.

674
00:49:07,499 --> 00:49:08,608
<i>Neha.</i>

675
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,235


676
00:49:47,593 --> 00:49:48,614


677
00:49:55,461 --> 00:49:57,125
This is my mom's wedding sari.

678
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,935
Get married?

679
00:50:43,825 --> 00:50:44,825
I can not see you.

680
00:50:45,517 --> 00:50:48,260
Oh oh, it's harder to cope more.

681
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:51,786
Naha you have a call
- Who?

682
00:50:53,067 --> 00:50:54,080
Hello.

683
00:50:59,474 --> 00:51:00,505
Ronnie needs to go.

684
00:51:02,216 --> 00:51:03,216
Neha.

685
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,518
What has happened?

686
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:09,127
You just stay here, come here,
- Listen.

687
00:51:13,919 --> 00:51:14,888
Sorry.

688
00:51:15,341 --> 00:51:16,145
Give a second.

689
00:51:19,333 --> 00:51:22,669
Yes - Do not hack up the phone.
I want to hear what's going on there.

690
00:51:22,892 --> 00:51:23,654
Well

691
00:51:32,325 --> 00:51:33,357
Third phase.

692
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:38,486
No, no, you will not get excited.

693
00:51:39,268 --> 00:51:41,221
Six months ago, an investigation revealed.

694
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:57,237
Are you married?

695
00:52:16,797 --> 00:52:18,016
Sorry.

696
00:52:19,433 --> 00:52:20,417
I'm drunk

697
00:52:22,351 --> 00:52:23,671
Thank you  Sorry.

698
00:52:25,115 --> 00:52:26,177
Sorry, sir, your purse  You've already come.

699
00:52:31,834 --> 00:52:33,373
But sir if he comes back to the police...

700
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,808
Sorry, sir.

701
00:52:48,003 --> 00:52:49,722


702
00:52:53,189 --> 00:52:54,095


703
00:52:54,168 --> 00:52:55,379
Abductions two months ago No, sir, I do not know anything about it  These cameras should see the images  Here it is

704
00:52:55,846 --> 00:52:58,174


705
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,456


706
00:53:04,955 --> 00:53:05,776


707
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:10,605
Give seven screenshots  Here sir

708
00:53:13,066 --> 00:53:13,707
Three-hour screenshot is missing.

709
00:53:22,392 --> 00:53:23,635
Do not know, sir ..

710
00:53:24,589 --> 00:53:25,769
How to disappear.

711
00:53:25,848 --> 00:53:26,620


712
00:53:26,654 --> 00:53:28,842
The three hours of the screenshot that went into the abduction. Where are they?

713
00:53:29,273 --> 00:53:30,258
How can it happen?

714
00:53:30,544 --> 00:53:32,107
Yes, sir, one day the police came.

715
00:53:32,247 --> 00:53:34,935
Boss sent us home early.

716
00:53:43,504 --> 00:53:45,613
Picture on the previous day.

717
00:54:08,463 --> 00:54:09,855
Do you know where the lost photos are?

718
00:54:09,981 --> 00:54:13,480
Sir, all these videos can be found in Boss' cabin.

719
00:54:14,287 --> 00:54:15,374
Can I see them in?

720
00:54:15,762 --> 00:54:17,796
It's a bit difficult sir, but you can do it

721
00:54:20,288 --> 00:54:21,624
As I meet, I want to make calls on my own.

722
00:54:21,872 --> 00:54:22,852
Well, of course, sir  This sir.

723
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:26,665
Who is this beggar?

724
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:28,087
Hey. It's our new AKP. Sir

725
00:54:30,153 --> 00:54:32,753


726
00:54:34,997 --> 00:54:36,637
But why are so many creeps for her?

727
00:54:41,788 --> 00:54:42,660
Good morning, sir  Morning.
- Welcome to cabbage.

728
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,893

'Koo' will be extended.

733
00:54:53,651 --> 00:54:55,160
Or it's a big deal.

734
00:54:55,412 --> 00:54:56,169
Carbon ..

735
00:54:56,823 --> 00:54:57,983
How was Carney G?

736
00:54:58,263 --> 00:54:59,303
Parent name .. Is it for spiritual protection?

737
00:54:59,577 --> 00:55:00,929
Rane ..

00:55:03,416 --> 00:55:05,333

00:55:05,797 --> 00:55:07,286


741
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:08,572
Yes, sir.

742
00:55:09,312 --> 00:55:10,646
What of your stomach so much?

743
00:55:11,031 --> 00:55:11,818

00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:17,593
Good?

747
00:55:17,924 --> 00:55:18,837
Well, sir.

748
00:55:18,981 --> 00:55:20,388
Well, I'm... Sir...  Bosco

749
00:55:22,131 --> 00:55:22,828


750
00:55:23,302 --> 00:55:25,447
What do the people of the department say about me?

751
00:55:26,313 --> 00:55:27,335
Nothing, sir.

752
00:55:28,104 --> 00:55:28,801
Do not you say anything?

753
00:55:29,462 --> 00:55:31,084
I do not say anything
- Something said  Say... tell me

Sir, this is ..

755
00:55:33,109 --> 00:55:33,987
Everyone tells you the antidote.

756
00:55:34,174 --> 00:55:36,776


757
00:55:40,381 --> 00:55:41,139
Do you speak the gonor?

758
00:55:41,974 --> 00:55:42,641
She ..?

759
00:55:43,044 --> 00:55:44,084
No, sir.

760
00:55:45,099 --> 00:55:47,100
The robot is telling me ..
- No sir Who says?
You tell me?

761
00:55:47,178 --> 00:55:48,921
Sorry, sir.

762
00:55:49,197 --> 00:55:50,225


763
00:55:50,328 --> 00:55:51,644
What do you mean?
- No sir.

764
00:55:51,962 --> 00:55:53,206
Who says?

765
00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:54,390
Take the number.

766
00:55:59,065 --> 00:56:00,958
What are you crying boss?

767
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:01,980
I made a joke...

768
00:56:02,467 --> 00:56:04,750
It's gone...
- Sir, Mr. DIG is calling you.

769
00:56:05,166 --> 00:56:06,367
HAHHH.

770
00:56:06,692 --> 00:56:08,657
These are the seniors. Are they always eating us?  Sir.

771
00:56:09,865 --> 00:56:10,394


772
00:56:10,922 --> 00:56:12,100
Come In...

773
00:56:12,575 --> 00:56:15,202
Loha Singhul .. or LSD

774
00:56:15,364 --> 00:56:16,391
Welcome to cabbage.

775
00:56:16,764 --> 00:56:19,192
Police are talking about you a lot.

776
00:56:19,913 --> 00:56:20,766
Sit down... sit down...

777
00:56:28,813 --> 00:56:30,250
Your name is very interesting What's the secret...?

778
00:56:31,896 --> 00:56:33,284
There's a sermon in that... that...

779
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:37,257


780
00:56:37,964 --> 00:56:39,618
If you're in Rome...... be like a Roman  I was living with a rowdler, so I thought to be like that.

781
00:56:40,279 --> 00:56:42,533
Sometimes, sir.

782
00:56:43,224 --> 00:56:44,251


783
00:56:44,955 --> 00:56:46,271
Yes, yes It's time to drag on a path  See the LSD gentlemen.

784
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,627
The day you spend is correct.

785
00:56:53,381 --> 00:56:54,450


786
00:56:55,568 --> 00:56:56,626


787
00:56:58,044 --> 00:56:59,546
But the system is very wrong.

788
00:56:59,997 --> 00:57:01,728
My method is my identity, sir.

789
00:57:02,875 --> 00:57:04,324
Because it's not there

790
00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:08,170
LSD yesterday I killed three people.

791
00:57:11,091 --> 00:57:15,946
If you do not kill people, how can you put a sixty-five incumbent record?

792
00:57:17,726 --> 00:57:18,615
Fifty five Sir, it's... working  Besides the thieves, did you even spy on the police?

793
00:57:19,712 --> 00:57:22,022
Sorry Sir
- see LSD

794
00:57:22,767 --> 00:57:24,925
How about...

795
00:57:27,381 --> 00:57:29,442


796
00:57:31,709 --> 00:57:32,977


797
00:57:33,621 --> 00:57:34,528
I'll take care of Watch out... ... your image...  Do not look like your coat If you want to learn ..

798
00:57:35,634 --> 00:57:36,679


799
00:57:37,071 --> 00:57:38,194


800
00:57:38,759 --> 00:57:40,285


801
00:57:41,391 --> 00:57:42,881


802
00:57:43,531 --> 00:57:44,883
How Much Learn...

803
00:57:45,947 --> 00:57:48,687
Name how purely it is, even if there are ten non-tasking activators...

804
00:57:49,059 --> 00:57:50,171
Apology was received.

805
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:52,678
A record has been broken down...

806
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:54,150
Honor is increased.

807
00:57:55,056 --> 00:57:56,553
No, no, sir.

808
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,191
No, no, sir.

809
00:57:59,772 --> 00:58:02,566
It would have to be a cellfriend if you remember  Sir ..

810
00:58:03,686 --> 00:58:04,606
Wait a little  Get lost too  Get it, sir.

811
00:58:06,307 --> 00:58:08,615


812
00:58:09,276 --> 00:58:10,382


813
00:58:11,523 --> 00:58:12,365


814
00:58:14,341 --> 00:58:15,075
result.

815
00:58:20,959 --> 00:58:22,269
Do not worry, sir.

816
00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:24,697
They bring the flying up and down.

817
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:28,512
I see cabbage hatching...

818
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:30,027
Congratulations.

819
00:59:35,075 --> 00:59:36,120
How to?

820
00:59:36,792 --> 00:59:37,862
UMCan?

821
01:00:07,684 --> 01:00:09,145
Why are you coming after us?

822
01:00:09,824 --> 01:00:10,863
I'm looking for a little girl.

823
01:00:11,458 --> 01:00:13,652
I do not know about any little girl.

824
01:00:13,677 --> 01:00:15,617
But I can show you a big girl.

825
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:23,321
Stop ..

826
01:00:25,461 --> 01:00:26,410
Stop...

827
01:00:27,787 --> 01:00:28,910
Where is Rai?

828
01:00:29,288 --> 01:00:30,340
I do not know about "Ria."  I want to know where Ria is?
- I do not know anything  Right.

829
01:00:30,365 --> 01:00:33,177

01:00:42,985 --> 01:00:43,712


831
01:00:44,385 --> 01:00:45,912


832
01:00:45,959 --> 01:00:47,654
Who are those Russians?

833
01:00:49,138 --> 01:00:51,278
Oh, they are.

834
01:00:51,303 --> 01:00:53,069
An address was asked from me.

835
01:00:57,931 --> 01:00:59,824
Do you give so much money saying an address?

836
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:00,770
Please, bro.

837
01:01:00,918 --> 01:01:02,071

Or I'll get it Do you know the child?

839
01:01:04,584 --> 01:01:05,346
It's a brooch.

840
01:01:05,659 --> 01:01:06,554
This cabbage ..

841
01:01:09,085 --> 01:01:09,848


842
01:01:10,004 --> 01:01:10,641


843
01:01:11,441 --> 01:01:13,779
I've been selling a lot of drugs ..

844
01:01:14,939 --> 01:01:15,539
Good.

845
01:01:16,748 --> 01:01:19,620
If I make a mistake .. I also have it.

846
01:01:26,646 --> 01:01:27,439
You are a very ordinary man.

847
01:01:28,213 --> 01:01:29,463
What does it involve?

848
01:01:30,281 --> 01:01:31,396
These are big big games.

849
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,278
If you have a little step in advance...  Imagine what would happen.

850
01:01:34,783 --> 01:01:35,678


851
01:01:38,118 --> 01:01:39,524
The Usman step left.

852
01:01:41,291 --> 01:01:42,481
Two are done.

853
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:44,710
Hey...

854
01:01:46,616 --> 01:01:47,349

855
01:01:48,118 --> 01:01:48,839
Are you mad?

856
01:01:49,164 --> 01:01:51,273
Two men come to 20

857
01:02:04,833 --> 01:02:06,328
He was not looking for you ..

858
01:02:06,353 --> 01:02:07,475
He has been picked up by me.

01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:19,231


861
01:02:19,255 --> 01:02:19,885


862
01:02:21,322 --> 01:02:22,902


863
01:02:23,346 --> 01:02:24,681

864
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:25,721
What do you want?

865
01:02:26,064 --> 01:02:27,362
Why are they fighting against them?

866
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:28,828
I'm looking for this baby  It was abducted two months ago.

867
01:02:29,669 --> 01:02:30,841

What do you see here?

870
01:02:37,631 --> 01:02:38,647
Did you think that you are holding a mantissa?

871
01:02:39,183 --> 01:02:40,865
I am the owner of the hire.

872
01:02:41,262 --> 01:02:42,458
That's where this is.

I have known this child for four years.

880
01:03:05,339 --> 01:03:07,057

I'm in the press. I'm in the arena.
I came to take the photo.

910
01:04:45,401 --> 01:04:47,877
What's wrong with Ronnie
is an advertisement for the newspaper.

911
01:04:47,901 --> 01:04:50,713

I do not have any answers to all your problems  And believe me.

914
01:04:55,233 --> 01:04:56,092

01:05:34,572 --> 01:05:37,469
Why to go to war with all the time!  If you have any information, you will get money.

926
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:42,697
Sir, I do not need money.

01:05:43,378 --> 01:05:44,868

Neha's car robbery ..

01:09:59,903 --> 01:10:01,057
It's a car robbery.

1012
01:10:01,941 --> 01:10:03,317
They had beaten her hard.

1013
01:10:03,563 --> 01:10:06,200
And Shakir.</i>

<i>Where is Ria?</i>

01:10:17,409 --> 01:10:18,449
<i>What action?</i>

1020
01:10:20,104 --> 01:10:21,167
Since he has regained his consciousness

1021
01:10:22,175 --> 01:10:24,074
I talked about a child.

1022
01:10:24,604 --> 01:10:26,613
asked people where our raria is.

1023
01:10:26,638 --> 01:10:29,353
<i>Have you seen our Russia?
- not..</i>

1024
01:10:29,378 --> 01:10:31,660
<i>Did you see my daughter, Anna?

<i>What are you doing this...?</i>
- Not only that.

1027
01:10:38,595 --> 01:10:40,677
A notice of a missing child in a foreign newspaper was seen.

1028
01:10:41,490 --> 01:10:44,318
I had a phone call and told me that this is our opera.

1029
01:10:44,604 --> 01:10:46,003
She was very upset.

1030
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:48,542
It was very difficult ..

1031
01:10:48,573 --> 01:10:51,081
<i>Neha please open the door.</i>

1032
01:10:51,106 --> 01:10:52,652
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

1033
01:10:52,677 --> 01:10:55,449
<i>We had a daughter, Shaikh.
- We did not have a daughter  We had a daughter, Shaikh.
- We did not have a daughter.</i>

1034
01:10:55,573 --> 01:10:58,558


1035
01:10:58,739 --> 01:11:00,487
He was sick while he was waiting.

1036
01:11:01,229 --> 01:11:03,206
PTST

1037
01:11:06,667 --> 01:11:09,980
post traumatic stress disorder
(post-traumatic stress disorder) Is it still?
- Yes.

1038
01:11:10,005 --> 01:11:11,730
Actually.

01:11:12,964 --> 01:11:14,011
We had to have an abortion

1040
01:11:15,076 --> 01:11:16,523


1041
01:11:16,857 --> 01:11:20,943
Nahi was always hoping that his mother would be his daughter.

1042
01:11:21,183 --> 01:11:24,097
Because of Naih's baby, his mother was gone.

1043
01:11:24,479 --> 01:11:25,675
And then...

1044
01:11:26,831 --> 01:11:29,231
This danger has changed all of us.

1045
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:31,969
<i>Come on. I'll show you every photo of Ria.</i>

1046
01:11:32,354 --> 01:11:33,746
<i>There is no photo.</i>

1047
01:11:33,771 --> 01:11:36,159
<i>What happened to Ria's photos?
Every room was left.</i>

1048
01:11:36,518 --> 01:11:38,120
<i>MY YOUR OWN RYAJA.</i>

1049
01:11:38,153 --> 01:11:40,446
<i>And Ria's favorite clothes in the cottage here  Ever since, do I explain to you that we have no daughter?</i>

1050
01:11:40,528 --> 01:11:42,938


1051
01:11:42,963 --> 01:11:44,856
<i>All of our pictures are here
_ Where are they now?</i>

1052
01:11:45,433 --> 01:11:47,839
<i>We do not have a daughter
- Where did she go? Where is Ria?</i>

1053
01:11:48,098 --> 01:11:49,708
This nonsense has gone further Next, he went to the police ..

1054
01:11:50,737 --> 01:11:53,152
= The complaint was made to the child where the missing person is

1055
01:11:53,183 --> 01:11:55,167


1056
01:11:55,323 --> 01:11:58,761
<i>I was just taking my child to school while I was leaving
A lot came. They took my daughter</i>

1057
01:11:58,870 --> 01:12:00,769


1058
01:12:00,794 --> 01:12:02,753
<i>I do not know how to find him All the police suspected me before.</i>

1059
01:12:02,987 --> 01:12:04,894
But later they understood...

1060
01:12:05,628 --> 01:12:07,738


1061
01:12:07,901 --> 01:12:11,089
They are... lying after lying  What is really ..

1062
01:12:12,104 --> 01:12:14,011
We did not have any daughter Ria  You mean...

1063
01:12:14,393 --> 01:12:16,300


1064
01:12:20,386 --> 01:12:21,417


1065
01:12:22,862 --> 01:12:25,355
All this... imagined in Naīa?

1066
01:12:25,776 --> 01:12:27,331
You are a police officer?

1067
01:12:28,839 --> 01:12:30,222
He met you in a normal way?

1068
01:12:30,978 --> 01:12:33,307
<i>Ronnie. My ..</i>

1069
01:12:36,961 --> 01:12:38,399
<i>Neha
- Hahh What kind of speech did you say to your friend.</i>

1070
01:12:38,424 --> 01:12:41,445
<i>No such thing happened
You got the wrong information</i>

1071
01:12:41,493 --> 01:12:44,836


1072
01:12:48,361 --> 01:12:49,938
I'm sorry, Shaker.

1073
01:12:52,650 --> 01:12:53,758
Mumbai...

1074
01:12:55,820 --> 01:12:58,492
Please do not do this again
It's fire in my mind...

1075
01:12:59,538 --> 01:13:01,093
More info...

1076
01:13:01,578 --> 01:13:02,740
You understand.

1077
01:13:03,897 --> 01:13:05,514
I already have a lot of trouble.

1078
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,727
Sir, I watch the watchman's house at school

1079
01:13:12,851 --> 01:13:14,703
CCTV scores
_ Come on You do not have a photo on the car or you do not have a phone or a home

1080
01:14:05,482 --> 01:14:09,668


1081
01:14:09,693 --> 01:14:12,535
Principel says that no kid was in school named Riah

1082
01:14:13,004 --> 01:14:15,144


1083
01:14:15,295 --> 01:14:17,692
I asked a newspaper asking me a question.

1084
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:21,238
= Shekker sent the message.

1085
01:14:21,543 --> 01:14:23,707
Police stopped investigating because you were wrong

1086
01:14:24,021 --> 01:14:27,840
Nobody has seen a daughter in school
No police station, Princess, No one knows

1087
01:14:28,332 --> 01:14:30,035
I saw CCTV eyes with I robbed me There's no one there you are  He was hiding behind the seat behind Ronnie.

1088
01:14:30,433 --> 01:14:31,832


1089
01:14:32,144 --> 01:14:33,856


1090
01:14:33,881 --> 01:14:35,715
Your
_ - She was scared  They are not your daughter but the car.

1091
01:14:35,902 --> 01:14:38,301
I came to Sheikher now.

1092
01:14:40,871 --> 01:14:42,231


1093
01:14:43,316 --> 01:14:44,551
You did not have a daughter.

1094
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:47,785
Please trust me, Ronnie How to believe?

1095
01:14:47,988 --> 01:14:48,793


1096
01:14:51,761 --> 01:14:54,488
You give the child in the photo and say that he is someone else  Everyone is lying, Ronnie.

1097
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:57,106
And you?

1098
01:14:57,457 --> 01:14:58,496


1099
01:15:00,207 --> 01:15:02,082
Did you tell me the truth for so long?

1100
01:15:02,511 --> 01:15:04,848
How to say how I say  I was scared.

1101
01:15:06,613 --> 01:15:08,426


1102
01:15:08,761 --> 01:15:11,020
Four years after you spoke to you ..

1103
01:15:11,254 --> 01:15:12,863
Nobody believes me.

1104
01:15:12,888 --> 01:15:14,270
Everybody says I'm crazy

How did these things happen?

1173
01:21:40,646 --> 01:21:42,969
I came from Canada this morning.

1174
01:21:43,281 --> 01:21:44,837
Take the flight list.
- All right, sir.

1175
01:21:45,021 --> 01:21:46,094
Why did you go to Canada?

1176
01:21:46,356 --> 01:21:47,600
My second office is mine.

1177
01:21:47,648 --> 01:21:49,020
If the second office...

01:21:49,045 --> 01:21:52,223

01:21:59,588 --> 01:22:01,769
Who do you have here...?

1182
01:22:02,883 --> 01:22:05,101
Nobody answers
- Bosco - yes sir  First lie.

1183
01:22:05,291 --> 01:22:06,314
Your brother came.

1184
01:22:07,471 --> 01:22:08,821
Sunny.

1185
01:22:09,226 --> 01:22:10,384


1186
01:22:11,853 --> 01:22:13,232
Has he pushed too hard?

1187
01:22:15,444 --> 01:22:17,152
She can make it.

1188
01:22:17,177 --> 01:22:18,374
My little brother is mine.

1189
01:22:19,105 --> 01:22:20,277
Very common guy.

1190
01:22:20,302 --> 01:22:21,996

1193
01:22:26,470 --> 01:22:27,337


1194
01:22:27,362 --> 01:22:29,493
If this is your brother, this has been done... Give it to us Vah Bosco.

1195
01:22:29,518 --> 01:22:32,019


1196
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,007


1197
01:22:37,031 --> 01:22:39,943
Both of you have to practice sleeping in the cement.

1198
01:22:40,291 --> 01:22:42,195
Why do not prisoners have bed...

1199
01:22:43,593 --> 01:22:46,243
open your ears and ask...

1200
01:22:49,647 --> 01:22:51,410
Your brain...

1201
01:22:51,464 --> 01:22:52,913

Or I'll turn you off forever.

1205
01:23:01,376 --> 01:23:02,626
I will be smart too.

1206
01:23:06,063 --> 01:23:08,261
We have a bosco.

1207
01:23:08,837 --> 01:23:10,937
What do you think, sir? Does he tell the truth?

1208
01:23:10,962 --> 01:23:13,378
I was looking for his own lame.

1209
01:23:13,403 --> 01:23:14,658
Got it?

1210
01:23:15,009 --> 01:23:17,099
It's a lone liar. That asshole.

But she is not killed.
- It means ..

1212

A suicide case
- No, bun.

1213
01:23:25,350 --> 01:23:28,202
The color of this case is too long to wait.

1214

Bosco ..

I would like to receive incoming calls, calls, watsup, snapshot, facebook

Family members say that Neha Sangolcker was in some form of depression.

Sir. This is Ranweer Prithaphon Singh, I know.

But I did not know that my lie would ruin anyone's life.

1297
01:28:06,460 --> 01:28:09,009
He was looking for his daughter like a madman.

1298
01:28:10,444 --> 01:28:13,266
Everyone in front is crying aloud...  No one believed.

1299
01:28:14,228 --> 01:28:15,597
I am loyal to you, Sagge...

01:28:27,016 --> 01:28:28,892

01:38:53,479 --> 01:38:55,641
You got my officers to hit your teeth, did not you?

1437
01:38:56,317 --> 01:38:59,478
You think that the whole police department was attacked?

1438
01:38:59,656 --> 01:39:00,841
How big will it cost you...

1439
01:39:00,866 --> 01:39:03,067
You are stubborn. Will melt and flow.

1440
01:39:03,276 --> 01:39:06,845
You always tie your hands and put your body in your cages...

1441
01:39:07,013 --> 01:39:10,474
Give one chance ▶ Show the strength of a soldier.

1442
01:39:15,681 --> 01:39:17,066
Let's see where we go  We will meet your will.

1443
01:39:17,662 --> 01:39:19,732
Get it off.

1444
01:39:20,767 --> 01:39:22,163
leave it ..

1445
01:39:53,270 --> 01:39:55,093
Drop it.

1446
01:39:55,142 --> 01:39:56,021
Both go back.

1447
01:39:56,163 --> 01:39:58,931


1448
01:40:09,947 --> 01:40:11,744
How low you are all Hey, you.

1449
01:40:11,997 --> 01:40:13,052
No.

1450
01:40:13,111 --> 01:40:13,746
Why should I get upset?

1451
01:40:14,907 --> 01:40:16,089
It's not a time of inquiry.

1452
01:40:17,698 --> 01:40:19,361


1453
01:40:19,562 --> 01:40:21,275
I had the time to touch them.

1454
01:40:22,526 --> 01:40:24,755
Meaning
- Meaning Sunny.

1455
01:40:25,717 --> 01:40:28,990
That kidnapping is behind
Why do not query?

1456
01:40:30,009 --> 01:40:31,197
evidence?

1457
01:40:32,369 --> 01:40:35,435
evidence ..?
- I have evidence.

1458
01:40:48,070 --> 01:40:49,445
Is this Ronnie real?

1459
01:40:49,516 --> 01:40:51,787
Have you seen that you have a place in Sanny's place?

1460
01:40:53,740 --> 01:40:56,002
Uthman do not worry
Nothing happens.

1461
01:40:57,018 --> 01:40:59,955
Tell the truth. What did you see?

1462
01:41:00,714 --> 01:41:02,662
I left for Sunny.

1463
01:41:03,535 --> 01:41:06,078
I saw a kid there.
- Good.

1464
01:41:06,539 --> 01:41:08,414
Can you just tell ya at your court (in court)?

1465
01:41:08,439 --> 01:41:10,133
Coat, what can I say?

1466
01:41:10,158 --> 01:41:11,343
No, no.

1467
01:41:11,503 --> 01:41:15,005
Can I say this at court?
- Hahh. - Well, then.

1468
01:41:16,216 --> 01:41:17,691
This is your responsibility to court.

1469
01:41:18,394 --> 01:41:19,342
Take the sunny.

1470
01:41:22,657 --> 01:41:24,145
And this is Sunny.

1471
01:41:24,986 --> 01:41:27,095
Yes, sir.
- Look at it.

1472
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:29,752
sir bugger
I'll take care of it  I'll see.

1473
01:41:30,020 --> 01:41:31,197
I will do so. Please

1474
01:41:32,062 --> 01:41:34,517


1475
01:41:42,034 --> 01:41:44,303
Hello, Sunny.

1476
01:41:44,708 --> 01:41:46,158
Salgunkar.

1477
01:41:47,125 --> 01:41:48,326
Now you tell me to tell...

1478
01:41:48,507 --> 01:41:51,831
<i>"Everything that says truth is only true. I do not say anything else but truth."</i>

1479
01:41:52,163 --> 01:41:54,097
No, it's old now.

1480
01:41:54,893 --> 01:41:56,402
Only in films are they going.

1481
01:41:57,327 --> 01:41:59,683
I ask only one question.

1482
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:02,720
The only one.

1483
01:42:04,817 --> 01:42:06,002
Where is Ria?

1484
01:42:06,456 --> 01:42:07,027
Sunny

1485
01:42:07,562 --> 01:42:08,306
What action?

1486
01:42:08,380 --> 01:42:11,005
DIG sir does not know who she is dealing with Your son's son.

1487
01:42:11,885 --> 01:42:13,736
Your donkey, he is Is he?

1488
01:42:14,396 --> 01:42:16,548


1489
01:42:17,854 --> 01:42:19,546


1490
01:42:19,793 --> 01:42:22,935
Oh, really .. Ria...
- Ahh Give one minute.

1491
01:42:23,025 --> 01:42:24,068
Ria... Ria ..

1492
01:42:25,339 --> 01:42:27,027
Where is Ria?

1493
01:42:27,276 --> 01:42:29,048
If you look, you will find the puck.

1494
01:42:31,482 --> 01:42:33,404


1495
01:42:33,429 --> 01:42:34,585
Check?

1496
01:42:36,956 --> 01:42:38,648
Is this a question for asking questions?

1497
01:42:38,976 --> 01:42:40,504
Just ask if you ask.

1498
01:42:42,433 --> 01:42:45,630
Sunny. Careful, careful.

1499
01:42:45,979 --> 01:42:47,975
Hey DIG ..
- Hmm ..

1500
01:42:48,010 --> 01:42:49,978
Do not smoke?
- Say where Rii was initially.

1501
01:42:50,181 --> 01:42:52,111
Do not Know - Sunny Sunny  I do not know.

1502
01:42:52,339 --> 01:42:53,218
I told you I did not know.

1503
01:42:56,507 --> 01:42:58,424


1504
01:42:58,692 --> 01:43:01,646
I will not leave you
now say

1505
01:43:01,671 --> 01:43:05,406
Now let's go. Or it's okay to

_ go back.

1506
01:43:07,289 --> 01:43:11,021
This is very dangerous
_ The way things are heard is very different.

1507
01:43:11,427 --> 01:43:13,297
I'm talking...

1508
01:43:13,809 --> 01:43:15,318
Stay back.
- No

1509
01:43:16,154 --> 01:43:17,681
Do not move.

1510
01:43:20,025 --> 01:43:21,939
Do not move, sir.

1511
01:43:28,493 --> 01:43:30,500
Put the gun on the side.
- Hey, Hey!

1512
01:43:30,913 --> 01:43:32,484
I know

1513
01:43:32,686 --> 01:43:34,082
you will kill me

1514
01:43:34,107 --> 01:43:36,227
I do not even save any of you.

1515
01:43:36,715 --> 01:43:38,287
Close your mouth I'm going to kill both of you.

1516
01:43:38,312 --> 01:43:40,617
Get down, Sunny.
Remove the gun

1517
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:43,979


1518
01:43:44,304 --> 01:43:46,291
Go back
- Shut up.

1519
01:43:51,862 --> 01:43:53,173
You can not die.

1520
01:43:53,226 --> 01:43:54,302
You can not die.

1521
01:43:54,404 --> 01:43:55,665
Suny, you can not die.

1522
01:43:57,848 --> 01:44:02,065
Sunny...

1523
01:44:03,355 --> 01:44:05,205
Ronnie. Those are not good.

1524
01:44:05,230 --> 01:44:06,698
The situation was out of control.

1525
01:44:07,667 --> 01:44:10,608
You have to control your temper.

1526
01:44:11,334 --> 01:44:13,230
I want revenge.

1527
01:44:13,340 --> 01:44:15,426
It's not the job of the police to revenge, Ronnie.

1528
01:44:16,067 --> 01:44:18,180
The police work law enforcement.

1529
01:44:18,659 --> 01:44:23,205
You told me that he was suing Naomi because he could not find his daughter.

1530
01:44:24,099 --> 01:44:25,436
Nobody cares.

1531
01:44:27,808 --> 01:44:29,938
Nobody cares. No one

1532
01:44:34,591 --> 01:44:36,200
Is happiness in these faces?

1533
01:44:38,384 --> 01:44:39,871
Smiling, happy faces.

1534
01:44:41,336 --> 01:44:42,621
My second anniversary is the day.

1535
01:44:44,896 --> 01:44:45,787
I was driving.

1536
01:44:47,667 --> 01:44:48,722
An accident.

1537
01:44:49,752 --> 01:44:51,054
My older brother.

1538
01:44:51,829 --> 01:44:52,690
My wife.

1539
01:44:53,516 --> 01:44:55,357
His child was eight months old.

1540
01:44:56,825 --> 01:44:57,851
Everybody lost.

1541
01:45:01,129 --> 01:45:02,483
The loss they lost.

1542
01:45:04,363 --> 01:45:05,418
And loneliness ..

1543
01:45:06,063 --> 01:45:07,235
I know both well.

1544
01:45:17,023 --> 01:45:18,209
It's a lot of love, is not it?

1545
01:45:19,994 --> 01:45:21,631
<i>Gee, this is not your life.</i>

1546
01:45:22,312 --> 01:45:23,703
<i>That life gave me daddy.</i>

1547
01:45:24,150 --> 01:45:25,484
I found in the nose college.

1548
01:45:25,797 --> 01:45:27,463
<i>This is his last request. (Last Will)</i>

1549
01:45:29,265 --> 01:45:30,490
<i>She's dying Ronnie.</i>

1550
01:45:31,572 --> 01:45:32,692
We were married.

1551
01:45:33,019 --> 01:45:34,831
<i>Look at the dad's condition.</i>

1552
01:45:35,668 --> 01:45:36,965
<i>Can not say no.</i>

1553
01:45:37,248 --> 01:45:39,089
<i>I do not have anyone else, Ronnie.</i>

1554
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:40,139
Shaker.

1555
01:45:40,550 --> 01:45:41,575
How did Shaikh come?

1556
01:45:41,662 --> 01:45:43,378
<i>In two days, Shaikhar and I will adore it.</i>

1557
01:45:44,290 --> 01:45:44,934
<i>What will happen to me?</i>

1558
01:45:47,556 --> 01:45:48,454
<i>I have to go.</i>

1559
01:45:51,302 --> 01:45:52,715
<i>I can not live without you.</i>

1560
01:45:53,904 --> 01:45:55,090
<i>You will not be able to forgive me...</i>

1561
01:45:57,522 --> 01:45:59,219
<i>But I have to try to forget.</i>

1562
01:46:01,204 --> 01:46:02,115
<i>Going Ronnie.</i>

1563
01:46:02,745 --> 01:46:03,359
Sir ..

1564
01:46:03,510 --> 01:46:04,954
Farm House has come up with goods.

1565
01:46:06,094 --> 01:46:08,072
Give the golden
gold  Goldfish.

1566
01:46:09,287 --> 01:46:10,267


1567
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:11,907
Sorry.

1568
01:46:52,035 --> 01:46:54,511
I send a photo  Well, just go Only Sunny was aware of where the child was.

1569
01:47:02,541 --> 01:47:03,714


1570
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:05,853


1571
01:47:06,730 --> 01:47:08,509
Sir, I have no battles with Sheikker.

1572
01:47:09,322 --> 01:47:11,087
But I know he knows the truth.

1573
01:47:11,698 --> 01:47:13,899
Sir, arrest him...
I promise everything will work right.

1574
01:47:13,924 --> 01:47:15,950
Only one can not arrest a person

1575
01:47:17,226 --> 01:47:18,810
We do not have any proof.

1576
01:47:20,512 --> 01:47:21,195
Well.

1577
01:47:28,670 --> 01:47:29,769
One more question.

1578
01:47:30,194 --> 01:47:32,620
This girl has four years old boyfriend...

1579
01:47:34,996 --> 01:47:36,721
I remember all the memories he has with him.

1580
01:47:39,978 --> 01:47:42,278
How he is forgotten ..
He has a kid or not.

1581
01:47:45,404 --> 01:47:47,749
Ronnie: I can understand what you are saying.

1582
01:47:49,662 --> 01:47:53,279
But I just have to say...
Do not just sit wrong...

1583
01:47:53,573 --> 01:47:56,378
If so, you... this case...
will be both annoying.

1584
01:47:56,946 --> 01:48:00,223
If Colonel Ranjit comes in...
can you imagine right now?

1585
01:48:02,470 --> 01:48:06,154
I do not know who my department is involved in.

1586
01:48:06,368 --> 01:48:08,278
LSD, hurt, or somebody else.

1587
01:48:08,386 --> 01:48:09,963
Give me about twelve hours.

1588
01:48:10,527 --> 01:48:12,993
I'll take this case to the best place and go.

1589
01:48:13,442 --> 01:48:14,721
Trust me.

1590
01:48:42,017 --> 01:48:43,852
UMC.
- Ronnie  Usman

1591
01:48:45,182 --> 01:48:46,291
Uh... Uh-Uh

1592
01:48:50,029 --> 01:48:53,739


1593
01:48:53,790 --> 01:48:55,605
What happened with Usman ..

1594
01:48:55,647 --> 01:48:58,105
Uh... I... I... uh... no... no....

1595
01:50:42,116 --> 01:50:43,366
= Usman .. Usman...

1596
01:50:44,890 --> 01:50:46,472
U.S. ..

1597
01:50:48,829 --> 01:50:51,382
My time is Ronnie.
- Do not say that, Uthman.

1598
01:50:51,407 --> 01:50:53,404
Do not say that. Please.

1599
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:06,237
U.S. ..

1600
01:51:10,146 --> 01:51:10,735
U.S. ..

1601
01:51:11,728 --> 01:51:12,596
U.S. ..

1602
01:51:14,931 --> 01:51:15,925
U.S. ..

1603
01:51:44,298 --> 01:51:46,198
I will send a photo Where is Geoffrey?

1604
01:52:02,592 --> 01:52:03,971


1605
01:52:04,339 --> 01:52:05,835
Indigenous borders...

1606
01:52:07,226 --> 01:52:08,655
In the middle of a forest of ten acres... When the Chattanooga River crosses...

1607
01:52:09,484 --> 01:52:12,007


1608
01:52:12,152 --> 01:52:16,371
The river is... an armed force...

1609
01:52:16,396 --> 01:52:18,626
It has the protection of the entire army...

1610
01:52:18,651 --> 01:52:20,992
There is Geiger's dwelling

1611
01:52:23,848 --> 01:52:26,862
Tell him that his goods will be heading for the shipyard tomorrow...

1612
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:29,652
Bye.

1613
01:52:45,935 --> 01:52:47,085
Quiet.

1614
01:52:47,412 --> 01:52:51,676
<i>Do not take a wrong move...
Or you... This case...
will be both annoying.</i>

1615
01:52:51,728 --> 01:52:52,843
<i>You need control over anger</i>

1616
01:52:52,921 --> 01:52:54,428
<i>Do you love him a lot?</i>

1617
01:52:54,453 --> 01:52:57,665
<i>I do not know who my department is involved in.</i>

1618
01:52:57,777 --> 01:52:59,569
<i>I'm shy about my officers.</i>

1619
01:52:59,622 --> 01:53:02,836
<i>Think Colonel Ranjith comes here  You should trust me ..</i>

1620
01:53:02,861 --> 01:53:05,243
<i>Once a soldier will always be a soldier.</i>

1621
01:53:06,361 --> 01:53:08,929


1622
01:53:25,045 --> 01:53:26,706
Hold it.

1623
01:55:07,323 --> 01:55:08,883
Sir, he entered the jungle...  The strength of a soldier can not be overcome.

1624
01:55:09,139 --> 01:55:11,305
It will not work...

1625
01:55:13,252 --> 01:55:15,038
Come to the reefs.

1626
01:55:17,088 --> 01:55:18,416


1627
01:56:35,462 --> 01:56:36,933
Colonel Sir
- Officer ..

1628
01:56:38,522 --> 01:56:40,286
Did Captain Ranveer know anything about it?

1629
01:56:40,602 --> 01:56:42,778
Not yet known, but we are looking for him.

1630
01:56:43,403 --> 01:56:45,234
But if we get caught...

1631
01:56:45,381 --> 01:56:47,045
imagine that you have gone up...

1632
01:56:47,156 --> 01:56:49,109
But if you explain to her...

1633
01:56:49,301 --> 01:56:52,088
Maybe... He will survive his life.

1634
01:56:52,289 --> 01:56:55,046
You are misplaced and misled by the officer I did not understand him or save her.

1635
01:56:55,276 --> 01:56:58,949
I came to save her from you.

1636
01:56:59,200 --> 01:57:01,711


1637
01:57:06,430 --> 01:57:08,049
This joke, right?

1638
01:57:08,074 --> 01:57:09,712
In his home...

1639
01:57:10,119 --> 01:57:11,825
If you enter it,  He will show you the hell...

1640
01:57:12,355 --> 01:57:13,938


1641
01:57:18,438 --> 01:57:21,062
In the war, there's nothing to lose her...

1642
01:57:21,087 --> 01:57:23,027
And it will not be left on your...

1643
01:57:31,419 --> 01:57:33,886
He represents himself an army...

1644
01:57:34,287 --> 01:57:36,107
You should be careful  I am asking briefly, Colonel sir.

1645
01:57:37,904 --> 01:57:40,058


1646
01:57:40,270 --> 01:57:43,261
I promise... the first bullet...

1647
01:57:44,020 --> 01:57:45,661
I have...

1648
01:57:45,805 --> 01:57:47,569
<i>Congratulations on your heart... !!!!</i>

1649
01:57:56,151 --> 01:57:57,815
Give me the gun...  Call the gravel...

1650
02:00:04,774 --> 02:00:06,011


1651
02:00:07,863 --> 02:00:09,002
Calling gravel...

1652
02:00:53,608 --> 02:00:55,403
Sir, you can not stop him  Get Machines... Call Alfa One
_ What's wrong with anyone?

1653
02:00:55,548 --> 02:00:56,776


1654
02:03:17,092 --> 02:03:19,110


1655
02:03:26,420 --> 02:03:28,307
Hello... Call the Rangers Is not one or none?

1656
02:03:31,632 --> 02:03:32,559
Sir, he came in to the Farm House...

1657
02:04:36,549 --> 02:04:37,997
There was a lame daddy you ..?

1658
02:06:36,227 --> 02:06:37,676


1659
02:06:40,515 --> 02:06:43,205
Dad will forget another dream... You know, my older brother says...  It reads very much
I killed it ..

1660
02:08:00,178 --> 02:08:01,949
No, I told you.

1661
02:08:04,538 --> 02:08:08,043


1662
02:08:09,404 --> 02:08:10,967


1663
02:08:11,276 --> 02:08:12,880
You said no ..?

1664
02:08:14,937 --> 02:08:16,199
What do you want?

1665
02:08:17,020 --> 02:08:19,197
Ria...
- It's alive.

1666
02:08:19,345 --> 02:08:20,271
More?

1667
02:08:23,243 --> 02:08:24,673
Ria... Ria... Ria...

1668
02:08:24,860 --> 02:08:27,022
If I do not ask, what do I need?

1669
02:08:27,775 --> 02:08:30,566
I am from the government employment.

1670
02:08:31,369 --> 02:08:33,155
I needed one chance...

1671
02:08:34,750 --> 02:08:36,034
Find money.

1672
02:08:38,067 --> 02:08:39,630
I suddenly torched

1673
02:08:40,018 --> 02:08:41,157
I met ..

1674
02:08:42,418 --> 02:08:44,305
Riaia ..

1675
02:08:49,003 --> 02:08:52,095
<i>Sunny  Anne .. DIG sir  Today ..?
- Holiday today ..</i>

1676
02:08:52,697 --> 02:08:54,360
<i>Why the uproar?</i>

1677
02:08:54,385 --> 02:08:56,962
<i>What is it, sir? Where is the goods?</i>

1678
02:08:57,097 --> 02:08:58,334


1679
02:08:58,478 --> 02:09:00,822


1680
02:09:01,146 --> 02:09:02,005


1681
02:09:09,985 --> 02:09:12,150
<i>Good in the day.
- All right, sir.</i>

1682
02:09:19,463 --> 02:09:20,840
<i>What's that noise?</i>

1683
02:09:32,853 --> 02:09:34,104
<i>- Sir, do not shoot.</i>

1684
02:09:35,116 --> 02:09:36,053
<i>No Sir</i>

1685
02:09:36,078 --> 02:09:38,980
I'm going to know the real story...

1686
02:09:39,036 --> 02:09:41,224
Picking up to Shacker...

1687
02:09:44,204 --> 02:09:45,130
<i>Is this your brother?</i>

1688
02:09:45,841 --> 02:09:48,579
<i>one job... Can not you fix it?</i>

1689
02:09:49,092 --> 02:09:51,157
<i>Meaning
- Meaning ..</i>

1690
02:09:52,128 --> 02:09:54,505
<i>The things that have become so...... occurred under my consent ..</i>

1691
02:09:55,152 --> 02:09:56,124
<i>Under your knowledge...?</i>

1692
02:09:56,273 --> 02:09:58,918
It does not fill the stomach for money  But when I arrived...

1693
02:10:00,096 --> 02:10:01,938


1694
02:10:02,195 --> 02:10:03,624
The heart fills up...

1695
02:10:03,649 --> 02:10:06,012
Other is my heart too big ..

1696
02:10:06,837 --> 02:10:08,925
<i>You misbehave with the child...</i>

1697
02:10:09,739 --> 02:10:11,749
<i>I do not know them and have no relevance  Now listen to what's relevant to me  My life's most important deal...</i>

1698
02:10:11,774 --> 02:10:13,758


1699
02:10:14,003 --> 02:10:17,017


1700
02:10:17,161 --> 02:10:19,528
Sheiker was a shipping company ..

1701
02:10:20,052 --> 02:10:22,563
Only Shakespeare could do my job.

1702
02:10:23,078 --> 02:10:26,773
<i>It's such a big thing .. It's going to be a big ship ..</i>

1703
02:10:26,795 --> 02:10:29,697
<i>Come next at least in the least two months ..
- Okay.</i>

1704
02:10:30,619 --> 02:10:32,305
<i>I will wait for two months</i>

1705
02:10:33,280 --> 02:10:35,367
<i>Then I will have your hostage  is alive...</i>

1706
02:10:35,813 --> 02:10:36,740
<i>I promise.</i>

1707
02:10:37,956 --> 02:10:39,318
<i>You do my job...
I'll do your job.</i>

1708
02:10:39,407 --> 02:10:42,298


1709
02:10:42,673 --> 02:10:45,999
<i>But if something goes wrong then my brother will be both good...</i>

1710
02:10:47,087 --> 02:10:50,358
<i>The comrades of Salgonkar
_ are in jail for ever...</i>

1711
02:10:50,612 --> 02:10:51,629
<i>promise.</i>

1712
02:10:51,661 --> 02:10:53,812
I hate her to his wife...

1713
02:10:54,166 --> 02:10:56,175
I made her mad  no abduction was there ..

1714
02:10:56,316 --> 02:10:58,314
He wanted to kill him.

1715
02:10:58,339 --> 02:10:59,988


1716
02:11:03,938 --> 02:11:06,305
<i>Where is Ria?
- What did you do?</i>

1717
02:11:06,416 --> 02:11:08,336
I did not want to kill Ria ..

1718
02:11:08,470 --> 02:11:12,923
Shakir wants shakers... Sheker totally destroyed Riah's mind.

1719
02:11:15,307 --> 02:11:19,147
<i>Doctors say that Na'a can not open her anxiety.</i>

1720
02:11:19,187 --> 02:11:22,979
<i>We need to have no daughter to control it.</i>

1721
02:11:23,004 --> 02:11:25,033
<i>My daughter I lost...</i>

1722
02:11:25,058 --> 02:11:27,689
<i>My wife will not lose me
-Sheiker But this is wrong.</i>

1723
02:11:27,714 --> 02:11:31,227
<i>your lie is a lie. My family can be protected.</i>

1724
02:11:31,252 --> 02:11:32,164
<i>Please help me.</i>

1725
02:11:32,189 --> 02:11:35,780
<i>I can not live without my wife.</i>

1726
02:11:38,890 --> 02:11:40,464
<i>I can not live without my lair  Well ..</i>

1727
02:11:40,769 --> 02:11:41,841
<i>Salgoncker: We are with you  He helped me...</i>

1728
02:11:43,950 --> 02:11:45,780


1729
02:11:47,266 --> 02:11:49,067


1730
02:11:49,296 --> 02:11:50,903
so I helped him ..

1731
02:11:52,998 --> 02:11:55,347
<i>Will be there for more?
-</i>

1732
02:11:58,868 --> 02:12:00,085
<i>School welfare</i>

1733
02:12:01,762 --> 02:12:02,711
<i>Thank you, ma'am.</i>

1734
02:12:02,755 --> 02:12:03,492
<i>Thank you.</i>

1735
02:12:03,916 --> 02:12:05,189
<i>you delete ..</i>

1736
02:12:06,662 --> 02:12:08,582
<i>Finished.
- Let's go.</i>

1737
02:12:09,855 --> 02:12:11,997
<i>Curly .. - Yes Sir
- Close this case.</i>

1738
02:12:12,022 --> 02:12:12,976
<i>There is no trace in this.</i>

1739
02:12:13,847 --> 02:12:14,921
<i>I'm talking.</i>

1740
02:12:14,965 --> 02:12:19,541
<i>Hear it. Her method is so different.
Take my gun from my waist  Calm down.</i>

1741
02:12:19,566 --> 02:12:21,048
<i>I arrived...</i>

1742
02:12:21,129 --> 02:12:22,856


1743
02:12:23,325 --> 02:12:25,323
So I had to finish it.

1744
02:12:28,302 --> 02:12:30,948
Not every war is won by strength...

1745
02:12:33,146 --> 02:12:35,155
For the brain won.

1746
02:12:36,095 --> 02:12:38,999
Everything you did was pretty good...

1747
02:12:41,796 --> 02:12:44,430
But the wrong child was chosen...

1748
02:12:50,992 --> 02:12:53,917
chosen child...

1749
02:12:59,700 --> 02:13:01,374
<i>Ria is my last...</i>

1750
02:13:01,399 --> 02:13:02,948
<i>I need your help.</i>

1751
02:13:12,057 --> 02:13:13,684
<i>They kidnapped my daughter  </i>

1752
02:13:28,732 --> 02:13:32,066
your eyes to see who can see...

1753
02:13:32,478 --> 02:13:33,796
<i>Ria...</i>

1754
02:13:42,410 --> 02:13:45,678
Go back...
Back to... Back...

1755
02:13:58,319 --> 02:13:59,845
Cabbage, Claire Sir...

1756
02:14:06,692 --> 02:14:09,237
Good Enjoy...

You can not die that way.

02:14:16,287 --> 02:14:17,568
Get up.

1759
02:14:17,593 --> 02:14:19,172
You can not die like that -

1760
02:14:19,223 --> 02:14:21,184
 Rise up. Ranveer...

1761
02:14:21,209 --> 02:14:22,490
Ronnie ..

1762
02:14:22,515 --> 02:14:25,280
No, sir, the gunman can not die...

I can not die like that...
- I know that child...

1764
02:14:28,598 --> 02:14:30,035
The war is over.

1765
02:14:30,060 --> 02:14:32,568
I can not die.
- I know kids ..

1766
02:14:34,688 --> 02:14:36,117
The helpless child, Ria sir...

1767
02:14:43,659 --> 02:14:45,742
The first bullet was right there, Colonel Sir...

1768
02:14:46,753 --> 02:14:48,327
The last one is dead

1769
02:15:18,017 --> 02:15:19,697
How can you be my friend ..

1771
02:15:22,263 --> 02:15:23,793
Three years old child...

02:15:59,284 --> 02:16:00,690
 I have dad..

1777
02:16:03,203 --> 02:16:05,078
Now you understand that...

1778
02:16:05,221 --> 02:16:09,786
Why did not you want to find Roya...

1779
02:16:10,701 --> 02:16:14,574
<i>the time we were together was the most beautiful thing in life </i>

1780
02:16:14,599 --> 02:16:16,762
 It will always be remembered...

1781
02:16:16,787 --> 02:16:19,239
<i>Then Ria was my last one  </i>

1782
02:16:37,159 --> 02:16:39,210
You can not forgive me...

1783
02:16:40,939 --> 02:16:43,049
