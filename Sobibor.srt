How could he have baptized them?

2
00:02:03,441 --> 00:02:06,561
It's just an ordinary river.

3
00:02:10,601 --> 00:02:12,921
Only Jews let themselves be baptized

4
00:02:13,161 --> 00:02:15,801
in an ordinary, dirty and stinky river.

5
00:03:23,601 --> 00:03:26,801
Welcome to Sobibor!

6
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:33,681
Welcome to your new lives!

7
00:03:35,761 --> 00:03:38,721
This is your home now.

8
00:03:48,841 --> 00:03:51,841
Welcome to Sobibor!

9
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:58,601
Welcome to your new lives!

10
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:04,121
This is your home now.

11
00:04:48,441 --> 00:04:51,401
I wonder for how long
they're going to separate us.

12
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:55,721
What will it be like?

13
00:04:56,561 --> 00:04:59,881
Three entire days!

14
00:05:00,921 --> 00:05:03,321
It's all because of their German order.

15
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:05,961
They're crazy about order.

16
00:05:06,561 --> 00:05:08,521
Can we trust Germans?

17
00:05:09,481 --> 00:05:11,281
You're panicking again!

18
00:05:11,481 --> 00:05:13,721
What a nervous companion I've got!

19
00:05:13,961 --> 00:05:16,321
Jacob, we'll work as usual.

20
00:05:16,521 --> 00:05:18,681
And we are immortal.

21
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:21,761
Why is that?

22
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:24,041
Because we are jewelers.

23
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:27,001
And gold is stronger than death.

24
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:37,601
You will get your suitcases later.

25
00:05:38,801 --> 00:05:40,601
Everything will be safe.

26
00:05:41,281 --> 00:05:43,201
Don't worry.

27
00:05:43,441 --> 00:05:44,961
I won't.

28
00:05:45,201 --> 00:05:46,481
Thank you.

29
00:06:30,601 --> 00:06:33,001
Welcome to the Sobibor camp.

30
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:39,401
Here you'll be able to work diligently
and live in dignity

31
00:06:39,561 --> 00:06:42,641
until your relocation
to lands liberated by the Reich.

32
00:06:51,841 --> 00:06:53,081
Don't worry.

33
00:06:53,321 --> 00:06:55,401
The separation of men and women
is temporary.

34
00:06:59,681 --> 00:07:03,281
Due to health and safety concerns,
you need to take a shower.

35
00:07:03,521 --> 00:07:06,401
This is necessary to avoid
a typhus epidemic.

36
00:07:09,241 --> 00:07:12,881
It's a bit boring,
but first things first.

37
00:07:16,201 --> 00:07:18,561
After, you'll all see each other again.

38
00:07:22,321 --> 00:07:25,441
Keep your vouchers, so that you can
easily find your luggage

39
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:27,441
and get settled in your houses.

40
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:30,001
You should take up any work.

41
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,721
Why?

42
00:07:31,961 --> 00:07:33,721
So that you stay alive.

43
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:38,561
Are there any craftsmen here?

44
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:41,281
Shoemakers, carpenters,

45
00:07:41,521 --> 00:07:43,481
blacksmiths, saddlemakers?

46
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:46,881
Seamstresses, dressmakers?

47
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:49,281
Jewelers?

48
00:07:49,521 --> 00:07:50,761
I'm a jeweler!

49
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:52,601
Him as well, he's my partner.

50
00:07:52,881 --> 00:07:54,041
Jewelers?

51
00:07:54,721 --> 00:07:56,281
I am a jeweler.

52
00:07:56,481 --> 00:07:58,121
Look at this ring.

53
00:07:58,401 --> 00:07:59,801
I've made it.

54
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,441
My wife's engagement ring.

55
00:08:02,681 --> 00:08:04,881
Great.
We'll find use for jewelers.

56
00:08:10,001 --> 00:08:12,521
What'd I tell you?
Stick with me, Jacob!

57
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:18,601
Seamstresses,

58
00:08:19,521 --> 00:08:21,081
dressmakers!

59
00:08:43,841 --> 00:08:46,401
Do not deviate from the order.

60
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:49,481
You are to undress completely.

61
00:08:49,721 --> 00:08:51,881
The women will shower first.

62
00:09:11,481 --> 00:09:14,081
I'll go with you.
Mom, Dad, go without us.

63
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:16,841
I want to stay with Shlomo.

64
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:23,561
Rivka, Mom and Dad will be angry.

65
00:09:23,841 --> 00:09:27,081
I'll make pretty earrings for you
and bring them to you tomorrow.

66
00:09:27,281 --> 00:09:29,721
Small ones, with blue stones.

67
00:09:30,161 --> 00:09:33,201
I don't want blue stones,
I want red ones!

68
00:09:34,401 --> 00:09:35,801
Rivka,

69
00:09:37,001 --> 00:09:39,481
your brother needs to get ready.

70
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:41,041
It won't take long.

71
00:09:41,921 --> 00:09:43,721
He was entrusted with a job.

72
00:09:48,361 --> 00:09:50,161
It's very important.

73
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:53,521
Don't scratch your pimple,
it'll leave a mark!

74
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,241
I'll put some turpentine on it tomorrow.

75
00:09:57,921 --> 00:09:59,081
Mom!

76
00:10:01,921 --> 00:10:03,801
See you in the morning, son.

77
00:10:17,601 --> 00:10:19,441
Finally we can have a shower!

78
00:10:20,081 --> 00:10:24,121
Yes, two days' travel without a shower
is terrible!

79
00:10:26,481 --> 00:10:29,121
Hurry up and take them away!

80
00:10:29,961 --> 00:10:32,081
Move along, move along!

81
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:35,201
Keep the child by your side.

82
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,401
God, how much longer?

83
00:10:39,641 --> 00:10:41,161
You're there already.

84
00:10:54,641 --> 00:10:56,481
Stop.
Go on!

85
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,641
- Wagner!
- What?

86
00:13:17,441 --> 00:13:19,641
What do you think?

87
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,321
Does it get him going,
or does nothing work for him anymore?

88
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:38,601
They got here from Minsk camp -

89
00:14:39,321 --> 00:14:41,841
they tried to escape but it didn't work.

90
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:45,681
I'm surprised they weren't killed.

91
00:14:46,281 --> 00:14:48,121
Kick the Russian out of here!

92
00:15:00,841 --> 00:15:03,241
Why are you telling us that?

93
00:15:04,561 --> 00:15:06,481
I'm just introducing myself.

94
00:15:06,721 --> 00:15:09,161
We're peaceful people, artisans.

95
00:15:09,401 --> 00:15:12,441
We're alive only because we follow
the rules.

96
00:15:12,681 --> 00:15:14,001
You're a provocateur.

97
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:16,081
And if we report you?

98
00:15:16,361 --> 00:15:19,361
Why weren't you shot in Minsk?

99
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:22,641
My brothers think you're not a Jew.

100
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,481
Enough.

101
00:15:35,161 --> 00:15:37,281
Look.

102
00:15:40,521 --> 00:15:42,361
I'm circumcised - like you.

103
00:15:45,321 --> 00:15:47,241
I'm a Jew - like you.

104
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:18,841
Some kind of underground they got here.
Quivering and praying.

105
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:21,241
Cowards.

106
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:23,441
They're like livestock going
to the slaughter.

107
00:16:23,641 --> 00:16:24,961
Damn kikes!

108
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:28,881
Sasha, let's leave without them.
I'll gnaw through this wire myself.

109
00:16:29,081 --> 00:16:32,401
- They'll shoot you from a watchtower.
- Don't jinx it!

110
00:16:47,201 --> 00:16:49,841
So, Sasha, what is your decision?

111
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:55,401
We've only been here for two days
and they've been here for a long time.

112
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:57,401
They know the camp
and the surroundings.

113
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,601
It's okay.
We'll win them over.

114
00:17:01,241 --> 00:17:02,681
Let's go.

115
00:17:43,441 --> 00:17:45,201
Mom only saw things like this
in shop windows.

116
00:17:45,401 --> 00:17:46,761
Can you imagine?

117
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:48,841
We didn't even dare to get close

118
00:17:49,121 --> 00:17:51,641
out of fear that we could've broken something.

119
00:17:51,881 --> 00:17:54,281
But I promised to myself
that I'd give my mom

120
00:17:54,521 --> 00:17:56,521
all the treasures of the world!

121
00:17:56,761 --> 00:17:58,801
So, did you?

122
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:01,481
No, I didn't.

123
00:18:03,361 --> 00:18:06,401
I could only look at them and admire.

124
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:09,001
But now I'll make up for it!

125
00:18:13,401 --> 00:18:15,441
The Jews have plenty of those!

126
00:18:18,601 --> 00:18:20,041
But, as they say,

127
00:18:21,761 --> 00:18:24,681
you can't take anything
to your grave, sadly.

128
00:18:25,721 --> 00:18:27,881
It doesn't belong to Jews anymore,

129
00:18:28,081 --> 00:18:30,881
it belongs to the German Reich.

130
00:18:32,001 --> 00:18:33,761
Don't spoil it, Wagner.

131
00:18:37,121 --> 00:18:39,441
It would fit my aristocratic hands well.

132
00:18:40,841 --> 00:18:43,321
Aristocratic?
How?

133
00:18:43,561 --> 00:18:46,921
You've been working on a construction site
with my brother.

134
00:19:03,361 --> 00:19:04,881
Wolff, this is for you!

135
00:19:05,121 --> 00:19:07,241
This would be perfect for you!

136
00:19:07,441 --> 00:19:09,521
Look, Beckmann!

137
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:12,201
You look great!

138
00:19:12,641 --> 00:19:14,361
A Pretty Jew!

139
00:19:14,561 --> 00:19:16,521
Welcome to the third camp.

140
00:19:16,761 --> 00:19:18,841
Into the showers, please,
for disinfection.

141
00:20:11,241 --> 00:20:13,201
I am a jeweler.

142
00:20:13,441 --> 00:20:15,001
Look at this ring.

143
00:20:15,241 --> 00:20:16,681
I made it.

144
00:20:16,921 --> 00:20:18,921
My wife's engagement ring.

145
00:20:21,441 --> 00:20:22,401
Good!

146
00:20:22,641 --> 00:20:25,361
I'll have an exhibition after the war.

147
00:20:25,561 --> 00:20:27,441
You will all die of jealousy.

148
00:21:21,161 --> 00:21:23,081
You're not allowed to go out.

149
00:21:23,281 --> 00:21:25,521
Not after lights-out.

150
00:21:27,121 --> 00:21:30,001
I didn't go out.
You imagined it.

151
00:21:32,721 --> 00:21:35,241
I saw you leaving the barrack, Sasha.

152
00:21:35,481 --> 00:21:37,481
Are you up to something again?

153
00:21:39,761 --> 00:21:41,321
No.

154
00:21:43,321 --> 00:21:45,121
Why do you...

155
00:21:45,361 --> 00:21:47,601
Why do you tempt fate?

156
00:21:58,681 --> 00:22:00,521
Try and forget about Minsk.

157
00:22:08,081 --> 00:22:09,841
It wasn't your fault.

158
00:22:10,081 --> 00:22:11,641
You're alive.

159
00:22:16,841 --> 00:22:18,601
Don't you want to live?

160
00:22:24,121 --> 00:22:25,761
No, Luka.

161
00:22:27,881 --> 00:22:29,801
Not like this.

162
00:22:32,001 --> 00:22:34,041
Nobody wants to live this way.

163
00:22:34,281 --> 00:22:35,921
Nobody.

164
00:22:36,441 --> 00:22:38,401
But we need to endure it.

165
00:22:39,081 --> 00:22:41,281
Endure and have faith.

166
00:23:52,161 --> 00:23:54,721
It's impossible to escape from the camp.

167
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:59,441
You've been warned, dear Jews.

168
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:03,481
Everyone should know:
escapees will die

169
00:24:03,721 --> 00:24:06,361
and innocent people will pay
with their lives for them.

170
00:24:06,561 --> 00:24:10,881
That's how it was before,
and that's how it'll always be.

171
00:24:11,441 --> 00:24:13,401
So, watch each other carefully.

172
00:24:13,601 --> 00:24:17,321
And report any suspicious activity
to your kapos, gentlemen!

173
00:24:17,561 --> 00:24:18,721
Jews!

174
00:24:18,961 --> 00:24:21,681
And now, we'll shoot every
tenth one of you.

175
00:24:21,921 --> 00:24:23,921
Cruel, but just.

176
00:24:24,561 --> 00:24:26,201
On your knees!

177
00:24:38,121 --> 00:24:41,401
One, two, three, four, five,

178
00:24:41,641 --> 00:24:44,881
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

179
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:48,361
One, two, three, four, five,

180
00:24:48,601 --> 00:24:51,961
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

181
00:24:52,201 --> 00:24:55,161
One, two, three, four, five,

182
00:24:55,641 --> 00:24:58,481
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

183
00:24:58,721 --> 00:25:01,601
Hey, Gustav, don't hurry!
You're breaking the rhythm.

184
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:06,161
One, two, three, four, five,

185
00:25:06,361 --> 00:25:08,881
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

186
00:25:09,401 --> 00:25:11,881
One, two, three, four, five,

187
00:25:12,121 --> 00:25:14,801
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

188
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:17,321
One, two, three, four, five,

189
00:25:17,561 --> 00:25:20,801
six, seven, eight, nine...

190
00:26:29,681 --> 00:26:31,401
What are you doing, Jews?

191
00:26:40,841 --> 00:26:43,081
You deserve your fate!

192
00:26:43,321 --> 00:26:44,761
Go to sleep.

193
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:57,201
The ashes of your relatives
fly into your faces.

194
00:26:59,321 --> 00:27:01,241
And you're just swallowing it?

195
00:27:03,361 --> 00:27:04,961
Damn you!

196
00:27:08,481 --> 00:27:11,241
Why are you lying?
My sister is alive.

197
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:15,081
I've made earrings
with red stones for her.

198
00:27:15,961 --> 00:27:17,961
My dear dad is alive.

199
00:27:18,841 --> 00:27:20,961
The Germans promised me!

200
00:27:21,401 --> 00:27:23,161
And Germans keep their word.

201
00:27:28,601 --> 00:27:30,241
Damn you...

202
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:33,121
Damn you all!

203
00:27:33,561 --> 00:27:35,761
Damn you all!

204
00:27:36,001 --> 00:27:38,041
Go to sleep, son of a bitch!

205
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:42,121
Damn you all!
Damn you all!

206
00:28:36,801 --> 00:28:39,321
I'll go with you.
Mom, Dad, go without us.

207
00:28:39,561 --> 00:28:42,361
I want to stay with Shlomo.

208
00:28:45,121 --> 00:28:47,961
Rivka, Mom and Dad will be angry.

209
00:28:48,201 --> 00:28:51,121
I'll make pretty earrings for you
and bring them to you tomorrow.

210
00:28:51,321 --> 00:28:53,161
Small ones, with blue stones.

211
00:28:54,481 --> 00:28:57,681
I don't want blue stones,
I want red ones!

212
00:30:41,441 --> 00:30:44,961
Yes, we have a committee.
You guessed correctly.

213
00:30:49,001 --> 00:30:51,921
We need a commander
with military experience.

214
00:30:54,161 --> 00:30:56,601
We had this Dutch man, Joseph Jacobs,

215
00:30:56,801 --> 00:30:59,121
a Navy officer, a brave guy.

216
00:31:00,841 --> 00:31:03,081
He led our preparations

217
00:31:03,801 --> 00:31:07,281
but kapo Berliner found out about it
and reported him.

218
00:31:08,361 --> 00:31:10,761
They've been torturing the Dutchman
for two days

219
00:31:11,001 --> 00:31:13,121
but he didn't give us away.

220
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:17,961
But the Germans shot 76 Jews anyway.

221
00:31:18,201 --> 00:31:20,201
And my Jews have lost their heart.

222
00:31:23,801 --> 00:31:27,201
How many receipts did your committee
give to the people at the station?

223
00:31:27,441 --> 00:31:30,481
You promised them that it would be fine,
didn't you?

224
00:31:34,241 --> 00:31:35,961
We're trying to survive

225
00:31:36,201 --> 00:31:37,641
to get our revenge.

226
00:31:40,321 --> 00:31:42,361
You're just trying to survive.

227
00:32:15,121 --> 00:32:16,881
One Reich, one Fuhrer!

228
00:32:59,281 --> 00:33:01,241
Found anything interesting?

229
00:33:02,401 --> 00:33:05,681
I haven't seen the kind of cuff links
that you want yet.

230
00:33:08,441 --> 00:33:10,921
You aren't looking well enough!

231
00:33:11,921 --> 00:33:14,041
You've been lazy!

232
00:33:15,281 --> 00:33:17,641
You are very lazy!

233
00:33:23,321 --> 00:33:26,161
Do you think I like beating you?

234
00:33:28,121 --> 00:33:30,121
This is all I've found.

235
00:33:30,961 --> 00:33:33,241
These are the things from the Paris train.

236
00:33:41,481 --> 00:33:42,681
Oh, wow.

237
00:33:44,201 --> 00:33:46,121
Must be from a banker!

238
00:33:47,361 --> 00:33:49,921
Wagner will piss himself with jealousy.

239
00:33:51,121 --> 00:33:53,201
Does Wagner have something like this?

240
00:33:53,441 --> 00:33:56,081
I've never seen anything like this.

241
00:33:57,441 --> 00:33:59,721
Expensive leather.
From the Chanel house.

242
00:34:02,321 --> 00:34:03,721
What a smell!

243
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:09,521
Have you ever heard of leather
smelling like flowers?

244
00:34:09,761 --> 00:34:11,041
It smells lovely.

245
00:34:14,081 --> 00:34:18,241
Well, I should reward you
for your good work.

246
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:20,641
C0gnac!

247
00:34:21,481 --> 00:34:25,161
Everything is French today,
it's not to be sneezed at!

248
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:30,641
Drink it.

249
00:34:32,041 --> 00:34:34,001
I'm a Jew, I can't have Cognac.

250
00:34:34,241 --> 00:34:35,481
Why?

251
00:34:36,121 --> 00:34:38,281
Our faith doesn't allow it.

252
00:34:38,521 --> 00:34:40,201
Do you have faith?

253
00:34:40,681 --> 00:34:42,281
All of us do.

254
00:34:44,921 --> 00:34:46,281
Pants off.

255
00:34:49,881 --> 00:34:52,161
25 lashes.
Count them.

256
00:34:52,401 --> 00:34:55,041
If you lose count, I'll start again.

257
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:01,801
One.

258
00:35:02,721 --> 00:35:03,601
Two.

259
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:06,121
Wrong.
Start over.

260
00:35:06,361 --> 00:35:07,641
One.

261
00:35:08,681 --> 00:35:10,041
- Two.
- Louder!

262
00:35:11,001 --> 00:35:12,241
One!

263
00:35:13,201 --> 00:35:14,401
Two!

264
00:35:15,201 --> 00:35:16,401
- Three!
- Louder!

265
00:35:17,121 --> 00:35:18,521
Four!

266
00:35:18,761 --> 00:35:19,841
Five!

267
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:21,521
Six!

268
00:35:23,001 --> 00:35:24,401
Seven!

269
00:35:24,641 --> 00:35:26,161
Eight!

270
00:35:27,081 --> 00:35:28,721
Nope.
From the beginning!

271
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:30,361
One.

272
00:35:30,601 --> 00:35:32,041
Two.

273
00:35:32,241 --> 00:35:33,561
Three.

274
00:35:33,801 --> 00:35:35,081
Four.

275
00:35:35,281 --> 00:35:36,601
Five!

276
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,361
Six!

277
00:35:38,601 --> 00:35:40,121
Seven!

278
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:05,241
Stop tormenting yourself.

279
00:36:08,161 --> 00:36:09,841
You can't live like that.

280
00:36:27,081 --> 00:36:29,321
They're expecting miracles from me.

281
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:32,241
And what can I do?

282
00:36:34,681 --> 00:36:36,601
I was a fool

283
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:39,481
playing a hero and a savior in Minsk.

284
00:36:40,201 --> 00:36:41,721
People died.

285
00:36:43,641 --> 00:36:45,081
And I'm alive.

286
00:36:48,121 --> 00:36:49,561
Enough.

287
00:36:52,721 --> 00:36:53,801
No more games.

288
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:04,921
This nightmare will end.

289
00:37:08,361 --> 00:37:10,081
Some of us will survive.

290
00:37:14,241 --> 00:37:15,481
Yes.

291
00:37:18,201 --> 00:37:19,561
For sure.

292
00:37:21,921 --> 00:37:23,241
And I pray...

293
00:37:26,921 --> 00:37:28,681
...that it would be you, Sasha.

294
00:37:33,721 --> 00:37:35,121
God will save us.

295
00:37:39,561 --> 00:37:41,721
Just don't get in his way.

296
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:46,761
Sasha!

297
00:37:49,001 --> 00:37:50,961
We just need to endure.

298
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,241
Endure and have faith.

299
00:37:56,001 --> 00:37:57,641
One!

300
00:37:58,601 --> 00:38:00,121
Two!

301
00:38:01,241 --> 00:38:02,881
Three!

302
00:38:04,161 --> 00:38:05,601
Four!

303
00:38:06,681 --> 00:38:08,041
Five!

304
00:38:09,281 --> 00:38:10,801
Six!

305
00:38:11,921 --> 00:38:13,561
Seven!

306
00:38:14,761 --> 00:38:16,241
Eight!

307
00:38:17,801 --> 00:38:19,401
Nine!

308
00:38:20,441 --> 00:38:21,401
Ten!

309
00:38:36,081 --> 00:38:38,321
Do you like it?

310
00:38:40,921 --> 00:38:42,041
No.

311
00:39:04,401 --> 00:39:06,921
And what if he gave it to you?

312
00:39:15,841 --> 00:39:17,721
Put the necklace on her.

313
00:39:18,521 --> 00:39:19,881
Come on.

314
00:39:44,201 --> 00:39:45,801
She's so beautiful.

315
00:39:49,481 --> 00:39:50,801
Don't you think?

316
00:39:54,241 --> 00:39:56,081
Come on,

317
00:39:57,001 --> 00:39:58,121
tell her.

318
00:40:05,841 --> 00:40:07,641
You are very beautiful.

319
00:40:11,721 --> 00:40:13,881
Now kiss her, Jew.

320
00:40:15,161 --> 00:40:16,841
Kiss her!
Kiss her!

321
00:40:17,921 --> 00:40:19,401
Come on, kiss her!

322
00:40:24,601 --> 00:40:26,881
I'm sorry, I can't protect you.

323
00:40:27,081 --> 00:40:28,601
Do what he says.

324
00:40:36,161 --> 00:40:38,001
No, no, no!

325
00:40:39,121 --> 00:40:40,841
More passion!

326
00:40:41,081 --> 00:40:42,281
More!

327
00:40:43,401 --> 00:40:45,161
Kiss her with passion!

328
00:40:45,361 --> 00:40:46,521
Passion!

329
00:40:47,561 --> 00:40:48,921
Go on!

330
00:40:49,161 --> 00:40:50,481
Kiss her!

331
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:52,361
Keep going, keep going!

332
00:40:52,601 --> 00:40:54,601
Keep going!
Keep going!

333
00:40:55,841 --> 00:40:58,281
More, more, more!

334
00:41:02,521 --> 00:41:05,001
My first woman was a Jew.

335
00:41:05,201 --> 00:41:09,401
She loved me and I loved her
more than anything in the world.

336
00:41:10,041 --> 00:41:11,761
We wanted to get married.

337
00:41:12,321 --> 00:41:14,961
But my father was an anti-Semite

338
00:41:15,721 --> 00:41:17,121
and he forbade it.

339
00:41:17,361 --> 00:41:18,721
And I obeyed.

340
00:41:18,961 --> 00:41:20,761
And she left for America.

341
00:41:20,961 --> 00:41:22,721
And what am I doing now?

342
00:41:23,321 --> 00:41:24,721
Killing Jews!

343
00:41:25,961 --> 00:41:27,761
And whose fault is this?

344
00:41:28,001 --> 00:41:29,241
Tell me!

345
00:41:29,441 --> 00:41:31,321
Is it her fault because she left me?

346
00:41:31,561 --> 00:41:32,961
Or mine only?

347
00:41:33,801 --> 00:41:35,441
Whose fault is this?

348
00:41:36,521 --> 00:41:38,601
It's my father's fault.

349
00:41:38,961 --> 00:41:40,321
It's his fault.

350
00:41:41,441 --> 00:41:42,961
His fault!

351
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:45,521
My father's fault!
My father's!

352
00:41:45,761 --> 00:41:46,921
My father's!

353
00:41:47,161 --> 00:41:48,081
My...

354
00:41:59,761 --> 00:42:02,521
Why is this Jew still alive?

355
00:43:25,001 --> 00:43:26,961
Hey, you.
Come here!

356
00:43:50,041 --> 00:43:53,121
I'll give you five minutes
to cut this stump up.

357
00:43:55,081 --> 00:43:56,481
If you can't do it,

358
00:43:56,681 --> 00:43:59,121
we'll shoot every tenth person here.

359
00:43:59,321 --> 00:44:00,641
Understood?

360
00:44:01,721 --> 00:44:03,281
Five minutes.

361
00:44:03,921 --> 00:44:05,641
Come on, let's go!

362
00:45:07,801 --> 00:45:09,281
Hurry up!

363
00:45:10,801 --> 00:45:12,441
Sasha!

364
00:45:12,681 --> 00:45:14,561
We just need to endure.

365
00:45:16,521 --> 00:45:18,241
Endure and have faith.

366
00:45:40,481 --> 00:45:42,081
Four and a half minutes.

367
00:45:43,601 --> 00:45:44,721
Good.

368
00:45:46,161 --> 00:45:47,641
Would you like an apple?

369
00:45:47,881 --> 00:45:49,081
Thank you,

370
00:45:49,321 --> 00:45:50,681
but I'm full.

371
00:45:54,561 --> 00:45:56,041
Take it.

372
00:45:56,281 --> 00:45:59,001
The food I'm getting here

373
00:45:59,881 --> 00:46:01,481
is enough for me.

374
00:46:05,441 --> 00:46:07,121
That's not all.

375
00:46:24,761 --> 00:46:26,161
Don't be afraid.

376
00:46:26,401 --> 00:46:27,761
Don't be afraid.

377
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:32,041
Would you like some sugar?

378
00:46:53,401 --> 00:46:55,161
What's your name?

379
00:46:58,241 --> 00:46:59,521
Keeping silent?

380
00:47:01,041 --> 00:47:02,881
I'll call you Silent then.

381
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:05,801
Silent!

382
00:47:08,841 --> 00:47:10,241
Okay?

383
00:47:25,201 --> 00:47:26,361
Silent!

384
00:47:34,881 --> 00:47:36,601
How long have you been here?

385
00:47:36,801 --> 00:47:38,201
Almost a year.

386
00:47:39,321 --> 00:47:41,201
Why are you still alive then?

387
00:47:41,801 --> 00:47:43,401
Don't be like that, Sasha.

388
00:47:43,881 --> 00:47:45,761
I'm a good worker

389
00:47:46,001 --> 00:47:48,361
and everybody needs good workers.

390
00:48:08,601 --> 00:48:12,601
I was a market director in Gliwice
before the occupation.

391
00:48:13,601 --> 00:48:15,201
I could do anything,

392
00:48:15,441 --> 00:48:17,161
I could organize everyone.

393
00:48:19,201 --> 00:48:21,641
But I won't be able to lead people.

394
00:48:22,121 --> 00:48:24,841
We need a commander
with military experience.

395
00:48:30,321 --> 00:48:31,641
Sasha?

396
00:48:32,121 --> 00:48:34,241
What a typically Jewish approach...

397
00:48:34,841 --> 00:48:36,361
Yes, Sasha.

398
00:48:37,321 --> 00:48:38,721
We...

399
00:48:38,961 --> 00:48:40,441
...need Moses.

400
00:48:44,441 --> 00:48:46,201
Enough.
Let's sleep.

401
00:48:47,561 --> 00:48:48,761
Sasha...

402
00:48:50,041 --> 00:48:51,961
You shouldn't behave like this here.

403
00:48:53,001 --> 00:48:55,081
You should swallow your pride.

404
00:48:57,561 --> 00:48:59,121
I'll think about it.

405
00:49:01,881 --> 00:49:03,081
Sasha!

406
00:49:37,361 --> 00:49:39,801
They'll report us to Berliner

407
00:49:40,001 --> 00:49:42,081
if they see us together again.

408
00:49:44,041 --> 00:49:47,121
They don't want another escape to happen.

409
00:49:47,521 --> 00:49:49,681
They're afraid of more executions.

410
00:52:14,481 --> 00:52:16,121
You're drunk again.

411
00:52:16,321 --> 00:52:17,681
Are you jealous?

412
00:52:17,921 --> 00:52:20,521
You're 15, but you drink vodka
every evening.

413
00:52:24,281 --> 00:52:25,641
I'm 100 years old.

414
00:52:26,681 --> 00:52:29,321
What would your father say?

415
00:52:29,561 --> 00:52:31,921
He won't say anything anymore.

416
00:52:32,161 --> 00:52:35,001
Shlomo, you've got hands of gold.

417
00:52:35,201 --> 00:52:37,441
What are you doing to yourself?

418
00:52:38,521 --> 00:52:40,081
Hello, kikes.

419
00:52:43,761 --> 00:52:46,081
Wait...

420
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:50,681
Where did you get it?

421
00:52:50,921 --> 00:52:53,801
Sometimes I find food
among the things I sort

422
00:52:54,281 --> 00:52:56,361
and manage to hide it.

423
00:52:56,801 --> 00:52:59,521
Do you want some?
Help yourself, please.

424
00:53:00,401 --> 00:53:02,121
I won't eat it.

425
00:53:02,321 --> 00:53:03,801
Leave him.

426
00:53:04,761 --> 00:53:06,281
Those people are long gone,

427
00:53:06,521 --> 00:53:07,761
but the food remains.

428
00:53:07,961 --> 00:53:09,361
Of course, they're gone.

429
00:53:09,601 --> 00:53:11,841
They've just burnt 100 people
and we're gorging on food in here.

430
00:53:12,081 --> 00:53:14,201
Why, we're safe here,
wiping Germans' asses!

431
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:15,881
Don't be a fool.

432
00:53:16,121 --> 00:53:17,921
Sasha, everyone is here.

433
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:20,201
We need to decide, Sasha.

434
00:53:23,641 --> 00:53:26,841
Yesterday, Wagner brought some golden teeth

435
00:53:27,681 --> 00:53:29,561
with pieces of jaw on them

436
00:53:31,481 --> 00:53:34,481
and asked me to make
a pin for his tie out of them.

437
00:53:36,401 --> 00:53:38,361
How can I stay sober?

438
00:55:21,001 --> 00:55:23,561
Work! Work!

439
00:55:44,921 --> 00:55:46,201
What?

440
00:55:47,641 --> 00:55:48,921
Easy, easy...

441
00:55:49,481 --> 00:55:50,641
What?

442
00:55:51,601 --> 00:55:52,841
Leo, Leo!

443
00:55:53,081 --> 00:55:54,641
Come here!

444
00:56:00,441 --> 00:56:02,081
What is he saying?

445
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:18,121
Nice shot, isn't it?

446
00:56:18,361 --> 00:56:20,281
Why so silent?

447
00:56:22,161 --> 00:56:23,641
What about this one?

448
00:56:24,601 --> 00:56:28,041
It's a great shot, Mr. Unterscharfuhrer.

449
00:56:29,521 --> 00:56:32,401
He just can't speak German.

450
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:36,161
Forget it.

451
00:56:37,121 --> 00:56:40,201
Welcome to Sobibor!

452
00:56:42,441 --> 00:56:46,601
Welcome to your new lives!

453
00:56:48,361 --> 00:56:51,241
This is your home now.

454
00:56:55,041 --> 00:56:57,161
He said the train came from Belzec.

455
00:56:57,681 --> 00:57:01,441
Belzec was liquidated in three days
on the commanders' order.

456
00:57:02,841 --> 00:57:04,961
And now we're supposed
to utilize the corpses?

457
00:57:05,201 --> 00:57:06,481
No thanks.

458
00:57:06,761 --> 00:57:08,041
They've thought it all through.

459
00:57:17,881 --> 00:57:19,601
Belzec is a camp, like our Sobibor.

460
00:57:19,841 --> 00:57:21,761
But it's farther east,
closer to the front.

461
00:57:22,001 --> 00:57:23,641
What was he saying before death?

462
00:57:23,881 --> 00:57:25,281
Allemen, allemen...

463
00:57:25,521 --> 00:57:27,761
What does it mean?
What did he want?

464
00:57:28,801 --> 00:57:30,201
It's Yiddish.

465
00:57:31,561 --> 00:57:33,721
It means "Avenge us, brothers."

466
00:57:34,001 --> 00:57:36,001
But how can we avenge them?

467
00:57:38,401 --> 00:57:39,481
Belzec...

468
00:57:41,561 --> 00:57:45,641
...was destroyed because Soviet troops
are heading west, to us.

469
00:57:48,041 --> 00:57:51,281
Maybe we just need to wait
for the Red Army

470
00:57:51,841 --> 00:57:53,001
and to survive?

471
00:57:53,681 --> 00:57:55,361
How long should we wait?
A year?

472
00:57:55,561 --> 00:57:56,841
You won't make it.

473
00:57:58,521 --> 00:58:01,041
They're going to kill us any day now.

474
00:58:02,681 --> 00:58:03,801
You, rat!

475
00:58:04,201 --> 00:58:06,001
I'll kill you, bastard!

476
00:58:06,241 --> 00:58:07,601
Stop it.

477
00:58:08,441 --> 00:58:09,721
Stop it.

478
00:58:23,241 --> 00:58:25,121
Our camp is the next one

479
00:58:25,361 --> 00:58:26,681
to be liquidated.

480
00:58:27,881 --> 00:58:30,121
They'll kill everyone - the kapos, too.

481
00:58:30,401 --> 00:58:33,721
The man on the train
who was shot by Berg,

482
00:58:33,921 --> 00:58:35,761
was a kapo in Belzec.

483
00:58:36,041 --> 00:58:38,321
They'll kill all of us together.

484
00:58:39,361 --> 00:58:40,881
Do you think I'm a sellout?

485
00:58:41,121 --> 00:58:42,401
I teach physics!

486
00:58:43,481 --> 00:58:45,801
I've been holding a pointer
in my hands all my life.

487
00:58:46,041 --> 00:58:47,481
And here I am.

488
00:58:49,721 --> 00:58:51,041
Have you ever killed people?

489
00:58:51,281 --> 00:58:52,721
No.

490
00:58:52,961 --> 00:58:54,361
Can you kill?

491
00:58:58,641 --> 00:58:59,761
I don't know.

492
00:59:04,361 --> 00:59:06,321
That's not how a provocateur
would answer.

493
00:59:11,361 --> 00:59:14,121
He has access to the rooms
where the officers reside.

494
00:59:15,081 --> 00:59:16,961
There are 12 of them.

495
00:59:17,161 --> 00:59:19,441
They're the brain of Sobibor.

496
00:59:20,401 --> 00:59:21,921
If we destroy the brain,

497
00:59:22,161 --> 00:59:23,361
we'll kill them all.

498
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:25,881
How can we do it?

499
00:59:28,401 --> 00:59:29,721
We'll stab them,

500
00:59:30,401 --> 00:59:31,481
tear them up,

501
00:59:32,521 --> 00:59:33,681
strangle them.

502
00:59:35,361 --> 00:59:37,521
We'll liquidate all the officers,
take their weapons

503
00:59:38,121 --> 00:59:41,081
and leave through the central gate.

504
00:59:42,641 --> 00:59:45,081
It'll be easier with weapons...

505
00:59:45,561 --> 00:59:46,961
Everyone.

506
00:59:48,361 --> 00:59:49,601
The whole camp.

507
00:59:51,801 --> 00:59:53,241
How...?

508
00:59:57,121 --> 00:59:58,841
It's everyone or it's no one.

509
01:00:00,761 --> 01:00:01,921
Any questions?

510
01:00:05,641 --> 01:00:07,121
Now leave.

511
01:00:29,721 --> 01:00:32,081
Tell your people that we need bullets.
They must get them.

512
01:00:32,281 --> 01:00:33,721
- How?
- I don't know how.

513
01:00:33,961 --> 01:00:35,401
You're the market director.

514
01:00:37,121 --> 01:00:39,401
I'll tell the women.
They know how.

515
01:00:51,441 --> 01:00:53,201
Is it hard to be all alone?

516
01:00:54,841 --> 01:00:55,921
Hang in there.

517
01:01:01,601 --> 01:01:03,001
Run.

518
01:01:06,201 --> 01:01:08,281
Father taught me and Rivka
to forgive people.

519
01:01:08,521 --> 01:01:09,961
If they are people.

520
01:01:11,081 --> 01:01:12,561
You are my father now.

521
01:01:28,681 --> 01:01:29,801
Sasha,

522
01:01:31,881 --> 01:01:33,241
can we really do it?

523
01:01:35,321 --> 01:01:37,481
Or will it be the same as in Minsk?

524
01:01:43,881 --> 01:01:45,081
I don't care

525
01:01:46,121 --> 01:01:49,081
even if it'll be the same as in Minsk.

526
01:01:53,161 --> 01:01:55,041
I can't take it anymore.

527
01:02:13,721 --> 01:02:14,881
Hey!

528
01:02:15,121 --> 01:02:16,401
Jew!

529
01:02:47,601 --> 01:02:48,881
Did you steal it?

530
01:02:52,041 --> 01:02:54,721
Well, I'm in a good mood today.

531
01:02:55,441 --> 01:02:58,001
Come here, Miss Busty!

532
01:02:58,761 --> 01:03:00,201
Come here!

533
01:03:00,681 --> 01:03:02,801
Yes, that's nice.
Oh, yes!

534
01:03:06,081 --> 01:03:07,281
What is this?

535
01:03:10,521 --> 01:03:12,041
What is this?

536
01:03:12,241 --> 01:03:14,881
Where did you get it?
Where?!

537
01:04:19,721 --> 01:04:20,961
Now what?

538
01:04:24,921 --> 01:04:27,761
I'll tell the Germans
that Baldy there got sick.

539
01:04:28,361 --> 01:04:30,481
They won't start looking for him
until tomorrow.

540
01:04:31,961 --> 01:04:33,601
- Are you sure?
- No.

541
01:04:37,121 --> 01:04:38,441
So, tomorrow.

542
01:04:41,521 --> 01:04:42,881
Tomorrow.

543
01:04:44,441 --> 01:04:48,281
Tomorrow we'll lure all the officers
to the workshop,

544
01:04:48,521 --> 01:04:50,561
one by one, all 12 of them.

545
01:04:50,961 --> 01:04:53,281
Three of them will be away on business.

546
01:04:54,641 --> 01:04:56,801
That leaves us with nine.
Even better.

547
01:04:58,361 --> 01:04:59,481
Use any excuse.

548
01:04:59,721 --> 01:05:03,321
Tell them you've got beautiful things
for them - boots, jackets, anything.

549
01:05:03,561 --> 01:05:06,641
The hardest thing is to lure them in
without arousing suspicion.

550
01:05:06,881 --> 01:05:08,161
Who can do it?

551
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:12,401
I can.

552
01:05:14,561 --> 01:05:15,841
Thomas.

553
01:05:16,081 --> 01:05:17,401
You can call me Toivi.

554
01:05:21,561 --> 01:05:22,961
It's a nice option.

555
01:05:28,281 --> 01:05:29,681
How old are you, Toivi?

556
01:05:29,921 --> 01:05:31,001
I can do it.

557
01:05:31,201 --> 01:05:33,641
They're not cautious of me.

558
01:05:33,881 --> 01:05:35,921
I polish their shoes and everything.

559
01:05:36,161 --> 01:05:39,041
I know how to tell them
about beautiful things.

560
01:05:39,241 --> 01:05:40,881
They'll trust me and come.

561
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:47,521
Come here, Toivi.

562
01:05:50,481 --> 01:05:52,881
You're going to take three officers
to the tailors,

563
01:05:59,081 --> 01:06:01,361
and three to the shoemakers.

564
01:06:01,641 --> 01:06:03,041
Arkady will take care of them.

565
01:06:03,961 --> 01:06:07,001
Neumann and Beckmann will stay
in the administrative corpus.

566
01:06:08,201 --> 01:06:09,361
Bzhetsky,

567
01:06:09,601 --> 01:06:11,441
you'll take two people there.

568
01:06:11,681 --> 01:06:14,241
I'll take care of Frenzel.
Borya, you'll cut the communication.

569
01:06:14,441 --> 01:06:16,281
I can't take two, I can only take one.

570
01:06:16,521 --> 01:06:18,281
I can bring him in and out.

571
01:06:20,201 --> 01:06:21,721
I have a pass.

572
01:06:27,081 --> 01:06:28,921
Moses, you'll go to Neumann.

573
01:06:32,081 --> 01:06:34,201
When we're done with the officers,

574
01:06:34,641 --> 01:06:37,921
Bzhetsky will give a signal for a line up.
We'll gather at the appel-platz.

575
01:06:41,161 --> 01:06:42,241
What is it?

576
01:06:42,721 --> 01:06:44,321
Did someone escape again?

577
01:06:46,561 --> 01:06:48,721
Don't stand close to each other in line.
You'll have a better shot at surviving.

578
01:06:48,961 --> 01:06:50,801
- Bzhetsky, don't sleep!
- Let's go!

579
01:07:48,761 --> 01:07:50,121
On your knees!

580
01:08:21,361 --> 01:08:23,601
Look at the puddle they've made!

581
01:08:24,041 --> 01:08:26,241
Smells like Jewish piss!

582
01:08:52,521 --> 01:08:55,361
Let's raise our glasses
to Oberscharfuhrer Frenzel!

583
01:08:55,601 --> 01:08:57,921
Hurray!
Music!

584
01:10:08,481 --> 01:10:10,441
Look, my horse is dead!

585
01:10:14,441 --> 01:10:17,441
You, come here!
Get moving, go!

586
01:10:19,761 --> 01:10:21,281
Let's go!

587
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:29,761
One!

588
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:33,521
Two!

589
01:10:37,001 --> 01:10:39,681
- Three!
- Three!

590
01:10:42,801 --> 01:10:43,881
Four!

591
01:10:46,481 --> 01:10:47,601
Five...

592
01:10:49,161 --> 01:10:50,721
...six...

593
01:10:51,601 --> 01:10:53,121
seven..

594
01:10:55,161 --> 01:10:56,121
...eight.

595
01:11:04,001 --> 01:11:05,841
You should have clean shoes

596
01:11:06,681 --> 01:11:09,761
when leaving for the other world.

597
01:11:10,721 --> 01:11:13,041
You, Jews, have no idea what beauty is.

598
01:11:13,601 --> 01:11:15,841
Jews don't have a sense of beauty.

599
01:11:17,201 --> 01:11:19,521
Dirty boots, dirty hands,

600
01:11:19,761 --> 01:11:21,401
dirty ears, dirty thoughts.

601
01:11:21,641 --> 01:11:23,121
Scum!
Dirt!

602
01:11:26,441 --> 01:11:28,801
Are you afraid?
Take a lesson from him!

603
01:11:29,041 --> 01:11:31,121
He's not afraid of anyone
or anything anymore.

604
01:11:33,601 --> 01:11:35,321
Polish the boots!

605
01:11:36,321 --> 01:11:37,561
Don't take pictures of me.

606
01:11:38,361 --> 01:11:40,121
I don't look so good today.

607
01:11:42,561 --> 01:11:44,721
Polish the boots!
Polish them!

608
01:11:48,881 --> 01:11:50,201
Polish the shoes!

609
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:53,721
Polish them!

610
01:11:54,761 --> 01:11:56,641
Do it!

611
01:11:57,921 --> 01:11:59,801
Shit!

612
01:12:07,561 --> 01:12:09,881
Good job, Whipped-Ass!

613
01:12:10,161 --> 01:12:12,801
Let's drink together.

614
01:12:14,601 --> 01:12:17,881
Your faith doesn't allow you?

615
01:12:19,361 --> 01:12:21,241
I'll have to baptize you.

616
01:12:22,081 --> 01:12:24,801
Now your name is not Haim

617
01:12:25,361 --> 01:12:27,041
but Heinz.

618
01:12:28,041 --> 01:12:29,881
We're friends now, Heinz.

619
01:12:30,121 --> 01:12:31,521
Drink.

620
01:12:34,201 --> 01:12:38,681
Does your whipped ass
not appreciate the honor?

621
01:12:38,961 --> 01:12:40,841
Lick the floor clean.

622
01:12:42,201 --> 01:12:46,441
You were offered a treat by an Aryan.

623
01:12:47,401 --> 01:12:51,001
And you claimed you didn't drink,
your law didn't allow you to...

624
01:12:51,201 --> 01:12:53,081
And look at yourself lapping it up.

625
01:12:53,321 --> 01:12:55,321
One can never trust a Jew.

626
01:12:58,001 --> 01:13:00,641
I'm John the Baptist!

627
01:13:05,721 --> 01:13:07,121
Jews!

628
01:13:07,361 --> 01:13:09,881
I'm John the Baptist!

629
01:13:15,841 --> 01:13:18,721
John the Baptist!

630
01:13:20,121 --> 01:13:23,641
I am John the Baptist!

631
01:13:26,001 --> 01:13:28,481
Where's my wife?

632
01:13:28,921 --> 01:13:31,321
Give me my wife back!

633
01:13:31,681 --> 01:13:34,361
Give me my wife back!

634
01:13:34,601 --> 01:13:36,401
Here's your wife!

635
01:13:39,961 --> 01:13:42,281
Give me my wife back!

636
01:13:43,681 --> 01:13:45,081
Give me my wife back!

637
01:13:53,321 --> 01:13:55,521
Give me my wife back!

638
01:14:48,601 --> 01:14:50,001
Out of the way!

639
01:15:05,441 --> 01:15:06,561
Please.

640
01:15:09,521 --> 01:15:11,081
Should I shoot him?

641
01:15:13,361 --> 01:15:14,641
No.

642
01:15:37,521 --> 01:15:38,881
My chair.

643
01:15:47,641 --> 01:15:49,481
I have the fastest horse.

644
01:15:52,601 --> 01:15:54,561
Whoever can beat me

645
01:15:54,761 --> 01:15:57,041
will get a whole case of cognac!

646
01:16:02,201 --> 01:16:03,721
Go.

647
01:16:11,361 --> 01:16:12,761
Enjoy.

648
01:16:16,521 --> 01:16:17,761
Run.

649
01:16:27,161 --> 01:16:29,561
Go, go!

650
01:16:32,761 --> 01:16:34,121
Faster!

651
01:16:38,241 --> 01:16:39,361
Faster!

652
01:16:42,641 --> 01:16:44,201
Faster!

653
01:16:57,601 --> 01:16:58,961
Run!

654
01:17:00,441 --> 01:17:01,481
Faster!

655
01:17:18,361 --> 01:17:19,801
Faster!

656
01:17:21,281 --> 01:17:22,641
Faster!

657
01:17:25,121 --> 01:17:26,561
Faster!

658
01:17:47,801 --> 01:17:49,561
Faster!

659
01:17:51,881 --> 01:17:53,281
Go!

660
01:17:55,241 --> 01:17:56,841
Faster!

661
01:18:28,321 --> 01:18:29,681
Faster!

662
01:18:31,281 --> 01:18:34,121
Great party!
See you next time!

663
01:18:34,321 --> 01:18:36,881
See you!
Don't fall out of the car!

664
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:28,881
Sasha!

665
01:19:29,081 --> 01:19:31,001
Sasha, Sasha!

666
01:19:32,201 --> 01:19:33,601
Sasha!

667
01:19:34,281 --> 01:19:37,881
Thank God!
You're alive!

668
01:19:38,121 --> 01:19:40,681
You're alive, Sasha...
You're alive!

669
01:19:41,161 --> 01:19:43,761
Sasha, Sasha!
Lord, you're alive!

670
01:19:44,561 --> 01:19:46,201
Sasha!

671
01:19:47,201 --> 01:19:48,841
Sasha!

672
01:19:53,041 --> 01:19:55,041
Lord, why did you do this?

673
01:19:57,521 --> 01:20:01,121
I just wanted to be a horse.

674
01:20:06,721 --> 01:20:08,481
A horse? Why?

675
01:20:09,721 --> 01:20:11,681
I was so scared...

676
01:20:11,961 --> 01:20:13,881
It was just a joke.

677
01:20:15,001 --> 01:20:17,681
I wanted to cheer you up.

678
01:20:20,201 --> 01:20:21,761
It wasn't funny!

679
01:20:22,841 --> 01:20:24,441
It was a bad joke!

680
01:20:26,721 --> 01:20:29,201
I understood what all of this is for...

681
01:20:29,921 --> 01:20:32,121
This war...

682
01:20:32,841 --> 01:20:34,841
...this damn death camp...

683
01:20:36,281 --> 01:20:37,761
I understood.

684
01:20:37,961 --> 01:20:40,361
All of this is...

685
01:20:45,041 --> 01:20:46,641
...is what?

686
01:20:47,961 --> 01:20:49,881
...to find you.

687
01:21:35,241 --> 01:21:37,601
I feel so good now...

688
01:21:39,161 --> 01:21:40,281
Really?

689
01:21:45,801 --> 01:21:47,081
Lord...

690
01:21:48,881 --> 01:21:50,281
Thank you.

691
01:22:35,961 --> 01:22:37,161
Look carefully.

692
01:22:37,401 --> 01:22:39,001
Take the stool,

693
01:22:39,241 --> 01:22:40,801
put it right here,

694
01:22:41,041 --> 01:22:42,921
so that when the German sits down,

695
01:22:43,121 --> 01:22:45,361
he'll have his back to Arkady.

696
01:22:46,761 --> 01:22:47,761
Got it?

697
01:22:48,641 --> 01:22:50,041
I understand.

698
01:22:52,441 --> 01:22:54,361
I'll show you again just in case.

699
01:22:55,721 --> 01:22:59,001
Take the stool, put it right here,

700
01:22:59,961 --> 01:23:02,761
so that the German's back
is facing Arkady.

701
01:23:02,961 --> 01:23:04,081
Clear?

702
01:23:04,321 --> 01:23:05,921
I understand, yes.

703
01:23:07,881 --> 01:23:09,601
Alright, show me, then.

704
01:23:16,041 --> 01:23:17,121
Like this?

705
01:23:18,161 --> 01:23:19,321
Yes.

706
01:23:21,921 --> 01:23:23,161
And you, Arkady...

707
01:23:24,441 --> 01:23:26,161
Go, Borya, go!

708
01:23:27,081 --> 01:23:29,041
Well, if you know everything...

709
01:23:31,961 --> 01:23:35,441
It's a great coat, a very fashionable one.

710
01:23:35,681 --> 01:23:38,361
Well, if you don't want it,
I'll go to Beckmann.

711
01:23:38,601 --> 01:23:41,001
Beckmann can do without it.
Let's go.

712
01:23:42,361 --> 01:23:45,521
If the coat is really good,
I'll give you some sugar.

713
01:23:46,321 --> 01:23:48,281
You like sugar, don't you?

714
01:23:49,081 --> 01:23:51,921
Yes, very much, Mr. Berg!

715
01:24:00,841 --> 01:24:02,161
They're coming!

716
01:24:11,681 --> 01:24:13,561
You're early!
I am not done yet!

717
01:24:13,761 --> 01:24:16,041
Unterscharfuhrer could only come now.

718
01:24:16,441 --> 01:24:18,281
Come to the light.

719
01:24:18,881 --> 01:24:21,121
Yes, yes!

720
01:24:24,721 --> 01:24:26,881
Wagner and Beckmann will burst with envy.

721
01:25:13,681 --> 01:25:15,001
Here.

722
01:25:20,321 --> 01:25:21,801
Come here.

723
01:25:41,561 --> 01:25:43,001
Jew!

724
01:25:45,201 --> 01:25:47,121
Give me the weapon!

725
01:25:47,321 --> 01:25:48,841
It's not for you!

726
01:25:52,921 --> 01:25:54,681
You won't dare to shoot!

727
01:25:55,801 --> 01:25:57,761
It'll cause too much noise.

728
01:26:03,201 --> 01:26:05,001
Too much noise?

729
01:26:05,241 --> 01:26:07,001
Well, I'll do it noiselessly then.

730
01:26:35,281 --> 01:26:36,961
Why did you go quiet?

731
01:26:37,161 --> 01:26:38,961
Work, work!

732
01:26:41,321 --> 01:26:42,801
Work!

733
01:26:46,281 --> 01:26:48,521
Just for you, Mr. Unterscharfuhrer,

734
01:26:48,761 --> 01:26:50,601
specially for you, a leather cloak.

735
01:26:51,441 --> 01:26:52,841
Only for you!

736
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:54,881
An expensive piece from Paris!

737
01:26:59,321 --> 01:27:01,601
He knelt in front of me, this scum.

738
01:27:02,521 --> 01:27:04,121
He's got no pride.

739
01:27:09,601 --> 01:27:10,961
You did well, Yusef.

740
01:27:11,921 --> 01:27:13,401
Yes, I did well...

741
01:27:14,201 --> 01:27:16,481
I had a wife and four kids.

742
01:27:16,921 --> 01:27:18,041
I did well...

743
01:27:19,281 --> 01:27:21,321
Something just for you,
Mr. Oberscharfuhrer!

744
01:27:21,801 --> 01:27:23,121
Come!

745
01:27:32,361 --> 01:27:34,761
An expensive item,
straight from Paris.

746
01:27:42,241 --> 01:27:43,401
Where?

747
01:27:44,481 --> 01:27:45,721
I'm sorry...

748
01:27:45,921 --> 01:27:48,361
This is specially for you,
Mr. Oberscharfuhrer.

749
01:27:48,601 --> 01:27:51,921
A leather coat.
A priceless piece, from Paris.

750
01:27:54,921 --> 01:27:57,721
Does Beckmann have anything like this?

751
01:27:59,721 --> 01:28:02,001
It's one-of-a-kind!
What do you think?

752
01:28:03,001 --> 01:28:06,641
Beckmann has a fetish
for fine leather goods.

753
01:28:08,121 --> 01:28:10,481
Should I offer it to Mr. Beckmann then?

754
01:28:11,481 --> 01:28:14,321
Why would you?
I'm taking this coat with me.

755
01:28:16,201 --> 01:28:17,321
Try it on..

756
01:28:18,481 --> 01:28:20,641
I'll make alterations...

757
01:28:22,761 --> 01:28:24,921
...so that it fits you perfectly.

758
01:28:27,081 --> 01:28:28,841
Everyone will admire you!

759
01:28:31,761 --> 01:28:33,001
Well, okay.

760
01:28:37,121 --> 01:28:38,481
But make it quick.

761
01:28:49,401 --> 01:28:50,721
A Photo?

762
01:28:50,961 --> 01:28:51,961
Sure.

763
01:29:26,921 --> 01:29:29,401
Where are those boots
I've been hearing about?

764
01:29:29,841 --> 01:29:31,641
Please, try them on.

765
01:29:51,521 --> 01:29:53,521
Don't piss yourself, little Jew...

766
01:30:17,441 --> 01:30:19,001
I'll kill you myself.

767
01:30:19,721 --> 01:30:22,241
Women tell me I smell like a corpse.

768
01:30:23,561 --> 01:30:25,521
I am Death!

769
01:30:51,321 --> 01:30:54,201
Boy, where are you?

770
01:30:56,681 --> 01:30:58,521
I'll punish you!

771
01:30:59,721 --> 01:31:02,041
Mommy...
Mommy...

772
01:31:11,481 --> 01:31:12,721
What are you doing here?

773
01:31:12,961 --> 01:31:14,361
I've brought you a pin.

774
01:31:14,601 --> 01:31:15,961
Put it down.

775
01:32:26,001 --> 01:32:27,961
Did you want cuff links?

776
01:32:32,561 --> 01:32:34,841
I'll make them out of your teeth!

777
01:32:59,681 --> 01:33:01,561
You taught the Jews to kill...

778
01:33:18,121 --> 01:33:19,841
You're just in time!

779
01:33:25,321 --> 01:33:28,641
You'll take a knife and then go
and stab him.

780
01:33:28,841 --> 01:33:31,361
Kill me... kill me...

781
01:33:31,601 --> 01:33:33,401
- I can't...
- Don't be afraid of him.

782
01:33:33,601 --> 01:33:35,361
- I'm sorry...
- You should be afraid of me!

783
01:33:35,601 --> 01:33:37,241
Leave him alone!

784
01:33:38,561 --> 01:33:40,001
- It's ready, commander.
- Good job.

785
01:33:40,241 --> 01:33:41,721
Sasha, Moses can't do it.
He's afraid of blood.

786
01:33:41,921 --> 01:33:43,801
- Who will go to Neumann?
- Where's Bzhetsky?

787
01:33:44,041 --> 01:33:45,681
- Go to Bzhetsky fast!
- Okay!

788
01:33:45,921 --> 01:33:47,601
Leo, I've got it.

789
01:33:48,561 --> 01:33:50,561
You're so brave, my girl.

790
01:33:59,641 --> 01:34:01,561
I've killed Neumann.

791
01:34:06,121 --> 01:34:08,321
Good job, boy, good job!

792
01:34:09,521 --> 01:34:11,361
Sasha, there are so many bullets there!

793
01:34:11,601 --> 01:34:13,761
Sasha, it's enough for us to break free.
Let's do it now!

794
01:34:14,001 --> 01:34:16,121
No, Borya, no.
The whole camp will escape.

795
01:34:22,001 --> 01:34:23,881
I've killed a human.

796
01:34:29,361 --> 01:34:30,881
I've killed him.

797
01:34:32,481 --> 01:34:34,801
Leo, which one of your people
can get to Beckmann now?

798
01:34:35,041 --> 01:34:36,881
- I don't know.
- I can!

799
01:34:42,321 --> 01:34:44,241
I have access to that barrack.

800
01:34:45,041 --> 01:34:47,041
Selma, tell them I can do it.

801
01:35:14,001 --> 01:35:16,441
Would you like some hot water with sugar?

802
01:35:24,681 --> 01:35:26,441
No!

803
01:35:28,081 --> 01:35:30,241
I'll never eat sugar again.

804
01:35:36,041 --> 01:35:38,041
They've taken your childhood
away from you.

805
01:35:42,321 --> 01:35:45,361
And you're helping us
to take their lives away.

806
01:35:45,561 --> 01:35:46,881
It's fair, Toivi.

807
01:35:53,321 --> 01:35:54,681
Find Shlomo

808
01:35:54,921 --> 01:35:57,441
and don't take your eyes off Frenzel.

809
01:35:59,441 --> 01:36:01,001
He'll handle it, Sasha.

810
01:36:23,681 --> 01:36:25,601
How could you do it?

811
01:36:25,841 --> 01:36:29,441
What do you have in your heart
that they've listened to you?

812
01:36:30,801 --> 01:36:33,121
Sasha has Stalin in his heart.

813
01:36:34,361 --> 01:36:35,881
Just like all of us.

814
01:38:45,601 --> 01:38:47,201
Where is everyone?

815
01:38:53,481 --> 01:38:55,001
What's going on?

816
01:38:55,201 --> 01:38:56,561
Where is everyone?

817
01:39:32,681 --> 01:39:34,401
Get the people up!

818
01:39:34,641 --> 01:39:36,081
Get them up!

819
01:39:36,281 --> 01:39:38,121
Get up! Everyone,get up!

820
01:39:45,481 --> 01:39:47,161
Leo!

821
01:39:47,361 --> 01:39:48,761
Tell them to run!

822
01:39:49,001 --> 01:39:50,561
Tell them to run!

823
01:39:50,801 --> 01:39:52,401
Run, run!

824
01:39:53,121 --> 01:39:55,201
Get up!
Get up!

825
01:40:10,241 --> 01:40:13,081
Run!
Run!

826
01:41:04,201 --> 01:41:05,841
Come on!

827
01:41:07,801 --> 01:41:09,081
Come on!

828
01:41:19,521 --> 01:41:20,761
Come on!

829
01:41:22,481 --> 01:41:24,081
Let's go!

830
01:41:35,241 --> 01:41:37,121
It'll be alright!

831
01:41:38,121 --> 01:41:41,281
Please, please, Silent!

832
01:41:41,521 --> 01:41:43,841
Let's go!

833
01:41:44,081 --> 01:41:45,921
I beg you, let's go!

834
01:42:15,881 --> 01:42:17,401
You've jinxed it.

835
01:42:38,921 --> 01:42:40,361
Lyuka!

836
01:42:40,561 --> 01:42:41,761
Lyuka!

837
01:42:42,441 --> 01:42:43,681
Lyuka!

838
01:42:44,761 --> 01:42:48,121
Lyuka, Lyuka!

839
01:42:48,801 --> 01:42:51,841
Sasha, Sasha, Sasha!
