1
00:00:00,337 --> 00:00:03,840
Previously on AMC's The Walking Dead...

2
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:05,508
I knew that I could count on you

3
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:07,325
to deliver my plan to Rick.

4
00:00:07,326 --> 00:00:08,833
He's gonna lead them

5
00:00:08,834 --> 00:00:10,713
directly into the line of fire.

6
00:00:10,714 --> 00:00:13,382
We will change Savior history.

7
00:00:13,383 --> 00:00:14,450
I just wanted to make it

8
00:00:14,451 --> 00:00:16,352
so that the bullets didn't work.

9
00:00:16,557 --> 00:00:18,710
You have to find peace with Negan.

10
00:00:18,711 --> 00:00:21,490
Show everyone that they can be
safe again without killing.

11
00:00:21,491 --> 00:00:26,363
Winning is about killing
every last one of you.

12
00:00:31,506 --> 00:00:33,275
I remember.

13
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:59,561
Saw she was up, so...

14
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,408
How'd it happen?

15
00:02:21,115 --> 00:02:23,117
Please tell me.

16
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:35,096
My mother's dead.

17
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,764
She was bit.

18
00:02:39,934 --> 00:02:43,438
I had to watch her die.

19
00:02:43,471 --> 00:02:45,673
Not long ago.

20
00:02:47,842 --> 00:02:53,715
And she believed people,
their... their souls...

21
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:56,951
trapped in the
bodies of the monsters...

22
00:02:58,007 --> 00:03:00,087
that killing the dead

23
00:03:00,121 --> 00:03:03,157
lets the living move
on into an afterlife.

24
00:03:07,294 --> 00:03:10,932
Carl was taking me back
to your community,

25
00:03:10,965 --> 00:03:14,002
and I told him what my mother believed.

26
00:03:16,371 --> 00:03:19,474
And we saw a few of the dead.

27
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:23,678
He wanted to honor her.

28
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:28,816
I think he was trying to show
me that I could trust him, but...

29
00:03:33,688 --> 00:03:35,790
That's how it happened.

30
00:03:38,893 --> 00:03:40,528
He died paying respects

31
00:03:40,561 --> 00:03:43,197
to a woman he never knew.

32
00:03:48,435 --> 00:03:49,971
But it was dangerous.

33
00:03:52,907 --> 00:03:56,177
It was dangerous, and I
didn't think about that.

34
00:03:57,361 --> 00:03:59,147
I should've.

35
00:04:04,952 --> 00:04:09,356
But all that's left of
the people we lose,

36
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:13,327
what was theirs...

37
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,663
are their ideas.

38
00:04:24,104 --> 00:04:26,207
Thank you.

39
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,612
We're gonna beat 'em today.

40
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,181
We are.

41
00:04:33,214 --> 00:04:37,951
And when we do, will you
come back to the Kingdom?

42
00:04:38,163 --> 00:04:41,088
I won't run away again.

43
00:04:41,121 --> 00:04:42,924
Maybe.

44
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,061
How you doin', boss?

45
00:04:48,596 --> 00:04:51,098
If this morning is to be our last,

46
00:04:51,132 --> 00:04:53,767
it will be a fine morning, indeed.

47
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:55,769
This isn't the last of shit.

48
00:04:55,803 --> 00:04:58,072
It could be for some of our ranks.

49
00:04:58,105 --> 00:05:00,574
I accept that.

50
00:05:00,607 --> 00:05:02,109
I'm not accepting shit.

51
00:05:02,143 --> 00:05:06,814
It's not simple acceptance
or pessimism, no.

52
00:05:06,847 --> 00:05:09,450
Not that.

53
00:05:09,483 --> 00:05:12,453
But to justify everything we've lost,

54
00:05:12,487 --> 00:05:15,156
we must risk losing everything.

55
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,390
We're not losing shit...

56
00:05:16,423 --> 00:05:17,992
Jerry.

57
00:05:24,632 --> 00:05:25,800
All right.

58
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,419
We'll stick to this road,
keep to the trees,

59
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,770
we'll get there quicker.

60
00:05:29,804 --> 00:05:31,505
Plus, we can keep an eye
on the road that way.

61
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,012
Yeah, if they're planning
anything, we'll see it.

62
00:05:33,013 --> 00:05:35,142
You think you can trust Gregory?

63
00:05:35,175 --> 00:05:36,201
What he told us?

64
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:39,113
I locked him up inside the house.

65
00:05:39,146 --> 00:05:41,148
He knew I wouldn't let
him walk around free.

66
00:05:41,181 --> 00:05:43,517
He knew he was coming back to that.

67
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,486
He doesn't believe in
anything except himself,

68
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,522
and he'd have to believe
in the Saviors a whole lot

69
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:50,023
to send us into a trap and
think it would work out for him.

70
00:05:50,024 --> 00:05:52,026
Unless Dwight didn't tell him.

71
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:53,694
That asshole could be setting us up.

72
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,449
Morgan.

73
00:06:14,482 --> 00:06:15,783
Morgan, what is it?

74
00:06:15,816 --> 00:06:17,885
They're gone.

75
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:20,487
They're doing something.

76
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:54,055
They were...

77
00:06:56,056 --> 00:06:59,193
They were gone... him.

78
00:06:59,226 --> 00:07:01,228
They were coming in.

79
00:07:01,261 --> 00:07:03,997
I asked Maggie if we could clear
the walkers from the wall.

80
00:07:04,031 --> 00:07:05,833
We... drew them away so we wouldn't

81
00:07:05,866 --> 00:07:08,602
have to worry about 'em
when we rolled out.

82
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,138
He did.

83
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,711
Let's keep gettin' ready, everyone.

84
00:07:17,745 --> 00:07:20,547
First team's going in 20.

85
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,684
He said when we roll out.

86
00:07:23,718 --> 00:07:26,520
You and your people aren't coming.

87
00:07:26,553 --> 00:07:29,189
You can be here.

88
00:07:29,223 --> 00:07:30,556
But you're not us.

89
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,729
As long as we got that straight.

90
00:07:37,631 --> 00:07:39,200
Maybe you shouldn't come with us.

91
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:41,002
I have to.

92
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,437
You've done plenty.

93
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,438
I have to.

94
00:07:44,471 --> 00:07:44,836
Morgan...

95
00:07:44,837 --> 00:07:46,574
Rick.

96
00:07:49,377 --> 00:07:53,448
I have to. I have t-to...

97
00:07:54,948 --> 00:07:57,385
It's not me.

98
00:07:57,418 --> 00:08:00,587
It's everybody else, and
I'm gonna keep 'em alive.

99
00:08:00,621 --> 00:08:04,392
I'm gonna keep Henry from... f...

100
00:08:08,295 --> 00:08:12,399
We...

101
00:08:12,432 --> 00:08:16,470
We are worse than we were... me and you.

102
00:08:16,504 --> 00:08:18,239
We are.

103
00:08:20,107 --> 00:08:22,910
Giving your word to those
men back at the bar.

104
00:08:22,943 --> 00:08:25,580
I mean, it's what it took, yeah, but...

105
00:08:29,683 --> 00:08:31,986
But that was something else.

106
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:35,255
That was something wrong for you.

107
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:42,029
And we crossed into it
because... because...

108
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:46,633
we've both lost everything,
everything good.

109
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:49,670
What...

110
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:52,673
What does it matter if
we spend whatever's left

111
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:54,775
on keeping people alive?

112
00:08:54,809 --> 00:08:58,479
Because we haven't lost everything.

113
00:08:58,512 --> 00:09:00,436
- Not yet.
- We have.

114
00:09:00,437 --> 00:09:02,450
And we can't go back.

115
00:09:06,028 --> 00:09:08,189
So let's just finish this.

116
00:09:58,315 --> 00:10:02,769
www.TUSUBTITULO.com
-DIFUNDE LA CULTURA-

117
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,073
Sucks, don't it, D?

118
00:10:25,074 --> 00:10:27,546
I mean, even with that disgusting,

119
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,715
knotted cheese on the side of your face,

120
00:10:29,749 --> 00:10:32,752
you once had these people's respect.

121
00:10:32,786 --> 00:10:34,988
But now?

122
00:10:35,021 --> 00:10:38,992
Well, now you don't have a damn thing.

123
00:10:42,995 --> 00:10:44,931
Load him up.

124
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:55,508
There's my bullet maker.

125
00:10:58,378 --> 00:11:01,714
AttachÃ© in tow and order
fulfilled PDQ, as promised.

126
00:11:01,715 --> 00:11:05,984
Every munition personally
quality-controlled by yours truly.

127
00:11:05,985 --> 00:11:07,853
Sleep be damned and efforts be tripled,

128
00:11:07,887 --> 00:11:10,656
the deed is done.

129
00:11:10,689 --> 00:11:12,525
Take yourself a tester.

130
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,017
Regina laid out the plan for you, right?

131
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,985
That's why I requested the ride-along.

132
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:41,187
Depending on the terrain and timing,

133
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,689
the pump and priming,

134
00:11:42,722 --> 00:11:45,458
I believe we should attempt
a one-fell-swooper.

135
00:11:45,491 --> 00:11:47,894
A firing line that would
minimize chaos opportunity

136
00:11:47,928 --> 00:11:51,398
and alpha-to-omega this
thing in less than 10.

137
00:11:51,431 --> 00:11:54,733
Are you sure that's
something you want to see?

138
00:11:56,181 --> 00:11:58,256
More of a "need to" thing.

139
00:11:58,257 --> 00:12:01,041
Look at you.

140
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:05,411
Let's load up, roll out!

141
00:12:05,445 --> 00:12:09,049
Lance, Duke... Boylan Road.

142
00:12:09,082 --> 00:12:11,517
Map will show you where
I'll be if there's trouble.

143
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,753
No, we got this one locked down, Jefe.

144
00:12:13,786 --> 00:12:15,822
Damn straight you do.

145
00:12:17,957 --> 00:12:19,993
Idiots.

146
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,498
Why don't you tag along, Gabey?

147
00:12:25,532 --> 00:12:27,199
It's a nice drive.

148
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:30,703
I got some shit that I want to confess.

149
00:12:36,761 --> 00:12:39,496
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

150
00:12:39,497 --> 00:12:40,733
Probably.

151
00:12:42,537 --> 00:12:44,596
Any second now.

152
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,900
Now, those men I sent out
down there on that road

153
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:49,755
setting up that roadblock with the dead

154
00:12:49,756 --> 00:12:53,263
not knowing they're joining
their cold asses any second.

155
00:12:53,826 --> 00:12:57,328
Because Rick and his band of pricks,

156
00:12:57,329 --> 00:12:59,117
they're gonna hit them hard.

157
00:13:02,502 --> 00:13:05,805
You know, I don't enjoy
sacrificing my own people.

158
00:13:05,838 --> 00:13:07,440
You know that, right?

159
00:13:07,474 --> 00:13:10,877
I mean, those guys back there,
they came up with Simon.

160
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,745
Some of us had to take one for the team,

161
00:13:12,778 --> 00:13:14,314
it may as well be them.

162
00:13:28,761 --> 00:13:30,730
I still don't understand.

163
00:13:30,763 --> 00:13:32,765
Ricky was slipped some intel,

164
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,301
make him think he can get the jump on me.

165
00:13:35,335 --> 00:13:38,437
The thing is, it came from a
less-than-reliable source,

166
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:41,975
so if I were him, I'd be scouting ahead.

167
00:13:42,008 --> 00:13:43,843
Taking out that little road-block crew

168
00:13:43,877 --> 00:13:46,413
is gonna make Rick think
he's got the real story,

169
00:13:46,446 --> 00:13:48,314
where I'll really be.

170
00:13:48,347 --> 00:13:49,949
They'll come to get me.

171
00:13:49,982 --> 00:13:52,618
But, see, that is the trap.

172
00:13:52,652 --> 00:13:55,355
And that is how we will get them.

173
00:13:55,844 --> 00:13:58,394
They're going to find a map
with the time and place I'll be

174
00:13:58,395 --> 00:14:00,138
and they're gonna believe it.

175
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,861
Because they will have killed
all those poor bastards.

176
00:14:02,862 --> 00:14:04,364
Hey, hey, hey! I give up!

177
00:14:04,397 --> 00:14:06,481
I give... I'm done!

178
00:14:06,482 --> 00:14:07,167
I'm done!

179
00:14:19,545 --> 00:14:21,848
Dude! That was messed up.

180
00:14:24,016 --> 00:14:26,519
I mean, Jesus.

181
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,228
You don't die, right?

182
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,398
Man...

183
00:14:38,431 --> 00:14:40,500
You oughta try it sometime.

184
00:14:43,336 --> 00:14:45,371
Listen...

185
00:14:49,075 --> 00:14:51,410
You don't think you can
kill your way out of this,

186
00:14:51,443 --> 00:14:53,412
seeing everybody else go, do you?

187
00:14:55,448 --> 00:14:58,350
'Cause let me tell you...

188
00:14:58,384 --> 00:15:00,486
not gonna happen.

189
00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:05,858
Morgan?

190
00:15:05,891 --> 00:15:07,861
Are you with us?

191
00:15:11,197 --> 00:15:13,399
Good people, found
something on our quarry.

192
00:15:14,566 --> 00:15:16,268
What is it?

193
00:15:16,302 --> 00:15:19,038
A list and another map.

194
00:15:19,072 --> 00:15:22,041
And what appear to be other facts.

195
00:15:22,075 --> 00:15:25,278
They're lining up Saviors
on the Old Mill Road.

196
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:26,679
That's where Negan will be.

197
00:15:26,713 --> 00:15:28,114
We have to get to Negan

198
00:15:28,147 --> 00:15:29,849
before they figure out
what happened here.

199
00:15:29,882 --> 00:15:30,843
Maggie.

200
00:15:31,546 --> 00:15:32,717
I'm here.

201
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:35,855
It's time.

202
00:15:35,888 --> 00:15:37,757
It was a trap.

203
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,960
So we're changing the plan.

204
00:15:40,994 --> 00:15:42,361
So that's it?

205
00:15:42,395 --> 00:15:44,196
Your confession is that you're...

206
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:48,033
gonna kill every last one of them?

207
00:15:48,067 --> 00:15:49,869
When you spoke before, you seemed almost

208
00:15:49,903 --> 00:15:52,238
as if you didn't want it to happen.

209
00:15:53,907 --> 00:15:56,642
It ain't about want, Gabey.

210
00:15:56,676 --> 00:15:58,077
It never was.

211
00:16:03,453 --> 00:16:05,284
No!

212
00:16:17,048 --> 00:16:19,116
Fell out the door!

213
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,920
Hang back! He can't see crap.

214
00:16:45,143 --> 00:16:46,978
Eugene, I have to warn them.

215
00:16:47,011 --> 00:16:47,526
- You can't do this.
- Shut up.

216
00:16:47,527 --> 00:16:48,979
Shut your damn mouth, or so help me,

217
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,255
I will use a homemade munition

218
00:16:50,256 --> 00:16:52,483
to crack your cranium
right here, right now!

219
00:16:52,517 --> 00:16:54,485
Do you understand?

220
00:16:55,254 --> 00:16:56,454
Do you?!

221
00:17:00,158 --> 00:17:02,093
Yes.

222
00:17:04,295 --> 00:17:06,765
Look at you.

223
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:09,234
Where does your faith go
when you truly need it?

224
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:14,572
Seems to me it's the only
time worth holding on to.

225
00:17:16,441 --> 00:17:18,343
Sorry, Eugene.

226
00:17:18,376 --> 00:17:22,646
I'm gonna have to call
dibs on Gabey boy myself.

227
00:17:27,118 --> 00:17:31,255
You said you didn't want
to die a fruitless death.

228
00:17:31,288 --> 00:17:35,593
Well, you can't always get what you want.

229
00:17:46,403 --> 00:17:48,806
Load him into the car.

230
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,880
You want to keep these people safe,

231
00:17:55,914 --> 00:17:59,617
and you think you need to
kill other people to do that.

232
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:03,454
That's not exactly safe
for you, which ultimately

233
00:18:03,487 --> 00:18:06,986
may not be safe for the people
you're trying to keep safe.

234
00:18:06,987 --> 00:18:09,360
It's a conundrum.

235
00:18:09,393 --> 00:18:12,397
Or it's not.

236
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:16,066
But you can stop people
without killing them.

237
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,836
I mean, you almost stopped me.

238
00:18:21,005 --> 00:18:23,574
I have a simple proposal.

239
00:18:23,608 --> 00:18:25,543
Something to try.

240
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:33,017
This end for the dead, and
this end for the living.

241
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,320
And things will get better.

242
00:18:39,123 --> 00:18:41,025
Jesus.

243
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:43,761
I'm starting to like that guy.

244
00:18:50,449 --> 00:18:51,669
Oh, Jesus.

245
00:18:52,795 --> 00:18:54,705
Holy damn.

246
00:18:54,738 --> 00:18:57,909
You ever seen one that big?

247
00:18:57,942 --> 00:18:59,677
No.

248
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,547
Things are changing.

249
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,782
Let's go.

250
00:19:04,815 --> 00:19:07,017
- How much further?
- We grow closer.

251
00:19:07,051 --> 00:19:10,188
Yonder, over the ridge.

252
00:19:24,435 --> 00:19:26,637
Saviors!

253
00:20:00,037 --> 00:20:04,241
Well, damn, Rick, look at that.

254
00:20:04,275 --> 00:20:07,111
Pegged again. Pegged so very hard.

255
00:20:15,474 --> 00:20:17,276
I ambushed your ambush

256
00:20:17,277 --> 00:20:21,348
with an even bigger ambush.

257
00:20:21,381 --> 00:20:24,317
How about you step out and face us?!

258
00:20:24,787 --> 00:20:27,420
Oh, I am everywhere, Rick.

259
00:20:27,453 --> 00:20:29,589
Some more bullhorns,

260
00:20:29,622 --> 00:20:31,658
more walkies.

261
00:20:31,691 --> 00:20:33,993
Pick a direction to run.

262
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:35,695
See how you do.

263
00:20:35,728 --> 00:20:38,030
Make it fun for all of us.

264
00:20:38,953 --> 00:20:40,700
Guess what else I did.

265
00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:43,870
I brought you some of your old friends.

266
00:20:45,805 --> 00:20:49,342
You remember your old buddy Eugene?

267
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:53,813
Well, he is the person
that made today possible.

268
00:20:53,846 --> 00:20:57,049
Same goes for Dwighty boy here.

269
00:20:57,766 --> 00:21:01,187
In case you were wondering, he
didn't ream you on purpose.

270
00:21:01,221 --> 00:21:06,626
No, he is just a... a gutless
nothin' that sucks at life,

271
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:11,498
and now he gets to stand up
here and watch you all die,

272
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:14,401
and he's gonna live with that.

273
00:21:15,365 --> 00:21:18,405
Gabriel, well...

274
00:21:18,438 --> 00:21:20,673
...he's got to go, too.

275
00:21:20,707 --> 00:21:25,311
We are cleaning house today, Rick.

276
00:21:25,345 --> 00:21:28,414
And then... there's you.

277
00:21:29,401 --> 00:21:31,884
It never had to be a fight.

278
00:21:31,918 --> 00:21:34,653
You just had to accept how things are.

279
00:21:35,466 --> 00:21:37,156
So...

280
00:21:38,134 --> 00:21:40,493
here we go.

281
00:21:40,526 --> 00:21:43,062
Congratulations, Rick.

282
00:21:55,164 --> 00:21:56,697
3!

283
00:22:01,914 --> 00:22:03,349
2!

284
00:22:14,058 --> 00:22:15,362
1!

285
00:22:30,743 --> 00:22:32,612
Now!

286
00:22:40,797 --> 00:22:41,888
Eugene!

287
00:22:58,004 --> 00:22:59,271
He's running!

288
00:23:20,727 --> 00:23:22,328
Is Gregory already out here?

289
00:23:22,362 --> 00:23:23,663
We left him inside the house.

290
00:23:23,696 --> 00:23:24,930
Let them have him.

291
00:23:24,964 --> 00:23:26,199
Keep going. To the rendezvous point.

292
00:23:26,232 --> 00:23:27,499
The others should already be there.

293
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:29,468
- Hold up!
- What's going on?

294
00:23:29,502 --> 00:23:31,170
I'm gonna try and slow them down.

295
00:23:31,683 --> 00:23:32,772
Go, go.

296
00:23:32,805 --> 00:23:35,308
What, just you?

297
00:23:35,341 --> 00:23:37,209
Look, they can hear her.

298
00:23:37,243 --> 00:23:39,678
- They can hear her in New Jersey.
- I don't know about Jersey,

299
00:23:39,712 --> 00:23:41,347
but I'm not letting you
do this by yourself.

300
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,848
You think I'm gonna give you a gun?

301
00:23:42,882 --> 00:23:44,317
I'm gonna stay one way or another.

302
00:23:45,885 --> 00:23:48,020
Any of you gents with me?

303
00:23:48,054 --> 00:23:49,188
'Cause I'm with her.

304
00:23:50,325 --> 00:23:52,525
Even if she's not with us.

305
00:23:56,996 --> 00:24:00,066
He did this! Get him!

306
00:24:17,218 --> 00:24:18,484
Morgan.

307
00:24:24,251 --> 00:24:25,453
Morgan!

308
00:24:25,454 --> 00:24:26,936
You don't have to.

309
00:24:32,298 --> 00:24:34,400
Let's clean this up now, shall we?

310
00:24:45,542 --> 00:24:47,013
Give it another second.

311
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:25,250
Don't shoot.

312
00:25:25,284 --> 00:25:26,719
Please.

313
00:25:30,382 --> 00:25:31,591
We're done.

314
00:25:31,624 --> 00:25:33,559
It's over.

315
00:26:33,465 --> 00:26:35,600
Just so you know,

316
00:26:35,633 --> 00:26:38,019
eenie meenie miney moe,

317
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:41,089
that was bullshit.

318
00:26:41,122 --> 00:26:43,691
I made a choice.

319
00:26:43,725 --> 00:26:47,028
I just didn't want to kill a
kid's dad in front of him.

320
00:26:47,062 --> 00:26:50,532
Turns out that would've been the
best thing I could've done.

321
00:26:50,565 --> 00:26:53,935
Had I done it, that kid
might still be alive.

322
00:27:03,044 --> 00:27:05,213
You're beat.

323
00:27:05,246 --> 00:27:06,414
Your people are down.

324
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,218
I'll get out of it.

325
00:27:10,251 --> 00:27:12,254
I always do.

326
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:18,092
It's just you and me, Rick.

327
00:27:18,126 --> 00:27:19,758
And you...

328
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:22,129
you are torn open.

329
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:24,260
I am bigger,

330
00:27:24,261 --> 00:27:26,393
I am badder,

331
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:28,363
and I got a bat.

332
00:27:28,364 --> 00:27:31,673
We can have a future.

333
00:27:31,675 --> 00:27:34,208
I know I will.

334
00:27:34,242 --> 00:27:36,244
Just give me... give me 10 seconds

335
00:27:36,277 --> 00:27:38,914
so I can... I can tell you how.

336
00:27:38,947 --> 00:27:40,582
No.

337
00:27:40,616 --> 00:27:43,318
Just give me 10 seconds for Carl.

338
00:27:49,324 --> 00:27:53,094
10...

339
00:27:53,128 --> 00:27:54,763
9...

340
00:27:54,796 --> 00:27:56,665
Carl said it doesn't have to be...

341
00:27:56,698 --> 00:27:58,572
it doesn't have to be a fight anymore.

342
00:27:58,573 --> 00:28:00,319
He was wrong.

343
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:00,968
8...

344
00:28:00,969 --> 00:28:04,339
No, no. He was right.

345
00:28:28,557 --> 00:28:31,533
Look what you did.

346
00:28:31,566 --> 00:28:36,705
Carl didn't know a damn thing...

347
00:29:40,802 --> 00:29:42,137
Save him.

348
00:29:45,607 --> 00:29:46,346
No!

349
00:29:46,347 --> 00:29:48,184
Maggie! Maggie!

350
00:29:48,185 --> 00:29:49,678
No, he can't!

351
00:29:49,711 --> 00:29:51,579
No!

352
00:29:51,613 --> 00:29:53,681
No, he killed Glenn!

353
00:29:53,715 --> 00:29:55,283
We have to.

354
00:29:55,317 --> 00:29:58,053
We have to end it!

355
00:29:58,086 --> 00:29:59,521
Rick!

356
00:30:01,255 --> 00:30:03,224
We have to make it right!

357
00:30:03,258 --> 00:30:06,261
We can't make it right,
but this makes it over.

358
00:30:06,294 --> 00:30:06,806
It's over.

359
00:30:06,807 --> 00:30:08,363
No!

360
00:30:08,396 --> 00:30:10,465
It's not over!

361
00:30:10,499 --> 00:30:13,301
It's not over until he's dead!

362
00:30:13,335 --> 00:30:16,438
It's not over till he's dead!

363
00:30:17,684 --> 00:30:19,908
No!

364
00:30:20,117 --> 00:30:21,409
No!

365
00:30:21,442 --> 00:30:23,879
No.

366
00:30:23,912 --> 00:30:25,247
No.

367
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,981
No.

368
00:30:30,452 --> 00:30:33,288
What happened, what we did...

369
00:30:33,321 --> 00:30:35,556
what we lost...

370
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:37,659
there's gotta be something after.

371
00:30:42,431 --> 00:30:44,966
The ones who have 'em up,
put your hands down.

372
00:30:47,602 --> 00:30:49,971
We're all gonna go home now.

373
00:30:52,974 --> 00:30:55,977
Negan's alive.

374
00:30:56,011 --> 00:30:59,281
But his way of doing things is over.

375
00:31:01,183 --> 00:31:02,683
And anyone who can't live with that

376
00:31:02,717 --> 00:31:07,322
will pay the price, I promise you that.

377
00:31:07,826 --> 00:31:09,524
And any person here

378
00:31:09,557 --> 00:31:15,361
who would live in peace and fairness...

379
00:31:15,362 --> 00:31:21,102
who would find common ground...

380
00:31:21,136 --> 00:31:24,639
this world is yours, by right.

381
00:31:24,673 --> 00:31:25,941
We are life.

382
00:31:25,974 --> 00:31:28,142
That's death!

383
00:31:28,176 --> 00:31:30,177
And it's coming for us.

384
00:31:30,635 --> 00:31:33,815
Unless we stand together!

385
00:31:33,849 --> 00:31:37,385
So go home.

386
00:31:37,418 --> 00:31:40,488
Then the work begins.

387
00:31:40,521 --> 00:31:43,992
The new world begins.

388
00:31:46,762 --> 00:31:50,165
All this...

389
00:31:50,198 --> 00:31:52,867
All this is just what was.

390
00:31:55,203 --> 00:31:58,306
There's gotta be somethin' after.

391
00:32:15,456 --> 00:32:17,258
What happened to their guns?

392
00:32:17,292 --> 00:32:18,759
Was that you?

393
00:32:19,827 --> 00:32:22,030
It was.

394
00:32:22,063 --> 00:32:23,865
I introduced a sabotaging aspect

395
00:32:23,898 --> 00:32:26,600
to the manufacturing process
unbeknownst to my colleagues,

396
00:32:26,634 --> 00:32:30,605
inspired by Gabriel's
purposeful ineptitude.

397
00:32:30,639 --> 00:32:35,200
And a few things you imparted
to me before I vomited on you.

398
00:32:35,201 --> 00:32:39,281
Ergo, I created a modicum of
phooey for a full kablooey.

399
00:32:52,627 --> 00:32:54,496
That's for the puke.

400
00:32:56,431 --> 00:32:58,333
Fair play.

401
00:33:01,936 --> 00:33:03,772
It's for Henry.

402
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,076
Will you tell him I'm gonna be okay?

403
00:33:09,677 --> 00:33:10,945
Are you?

404
00:33:12,614 --> 00:33:14,249
I'm gonna try.

405
00:33:16,585 --> 00:33:18,953
I know I need to be.

406
00:33:33,034 --> 00:33:36,137
My mercy...

407
00:33:36,171 --> 00:33:38,386
prevails...

408
00:33:38,387 --> 00:33:40,795
over my wrath.

409
00:34:08,883 --> 00:34:11,085
Excuse me. Maggie?

410
00:34:12,587 --> 00:34:15,523
The... guys are going
back to the Sanctuary.

411
00:34:15,557 --> 00:34:18,759
Gonna... try and make
something else out of it.

412
00:34:18,793 --> 00:34:21,896
I don't know.

413
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:24,632
The thing is...

414
00:34:24,666 --> 00:34:26,801
I was never meant to be there.

415
00:34:28,319 --> 00:34:29,270
I-I've been reading

416
00:34:29,304 --> 00:34:32,106
that book... "A Key to a Future."

417
00:34:34,775 --> 00:34:36,377
You know, I-I can build things,

418
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:37,811
I can make some of that stuff real,

419
00:34:37,845 --> 00:34:42,250
for... for this place, for these people.

420
00:34:42,283 --> 00:34:45,219
It... It's what I want
to do with my life.

421
00:34:48,122 --> 00:34:53,227
And, no joke, you... you
gave me that life, so...

422
00:34:55,329 --> 00:34:57,098
Okay.

423
00:35:29,363 --> 00:35:32,866
Hi. Glad you're here.

424
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,936
Glad to be here. I think.

425
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:38,306
Well, we know.

426
00:35:43,732 --> 00:35:45,179
That you guys?

427
00:35:45,212 --> 00:35:48,249
Yeah, more glass.

428
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,053
And more people to help
put it back together.

429
00:36:02,096 --> 00:36:03,798
Get out.

430
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:31,793
I know why I'm here.

431
00:36:37,265 --> 00:36:39,601
I know what I did to Denise.

432
00:36:42,203 --> 00:36:44,505
To you.

433
00:36:44,538 --> 00:36:46,708
To other people.

434
00:36:48,743 --> 00:36:51,045
And it doesn't matter why.

435
00:36:53,548 --> 00:36:56,452
I knew I'd have to face it...

436
00:36:56,453 --> 00:36:58,953
to pay, and I should.

437
00:37:02,036 --> 00:37:03,958
I'm ready.

438
00:37:09,096 --> 00:37:12,366
I got to see Negan taken
down, and that's enough.

439
00:37:15,503 --> 00:37:17,405
Me?

440
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,409
I'm a piece of shit.

441
00:37:24,912 --> 00:37:28,316
There's no going back to how things were.

442
00:37:42,363 --> 00:37:44,332
I'm sorry.

443
00:37:44,365 --> 00:37:47,768
Look, I'm so sorry.

444
00:37:47,802 --> 00:37:49,637
Please.

445
00:37:52,306 --> 00:37:53,840
Please.

446
00:37:53,874 --> 00:37:55,109
Shut up.

447
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:05,686
You go, and you keep going.

448
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:07,621
Don't you ever come back here again.

449
00:38:07,654 --> 00:38:09,957
If I ever see your face
around here again,

450
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,826
I'll kill you.

451
00:38:19,667 --> 00:38:21,636
You go out there, and you make it right.

452
00:38:27,808 --> 00:38:29,477
Find her.

453
00:38:40,354 --> 00:38:43,825
I'm a friend of Rick's.

454
00:38:43,858 --> 00:38:46,226
From Alexandria.

455
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:07,347
He says you can come
back to the community.

456
00:39:07,381 --> 00:39:11,018
If you wanna.

457
00:39:11,052 --> 00:39:13,820
Why?

458
00:39:13,854 --> 00:39:15,856
Rick is trying to build something.

459
00:39:17,457 --> 00:39:20,761
He needs all the hands he can get.

460
00:39:20,795 --> 00:39:23,831
He wants to show people
that things can change.

461
00:39:28,636 --> 00:39:31,605
You don't want to be alone.

462
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:34,909
People.

463
00:39:34,942 --> 00:39:38,512
Everything is about people.

464
00:39:38,546 --> 00:39:41,849
Everything in this life
that's worth a damn.

465
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,088
What's your name?

466
00:39:51,292 --> 00:39:52,593
Morgan Jones.

467
00:39:56,129 --> 00:39:58,232
You can call me Anne.

468
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,802
Let me get my things.

469
00:40:01,836 --> 00:40:03,204
- We can go.
- Or you can go.

470
00:40:03,237 --> 00:40:05,239
I'm gonna stay.

471
00:40:05,273 --> 00:40:09,276
I want to be alone. I...

472
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:11,278
I need to be.

473
00:40:11,311 --> 00:40:12,480
I thought you said...

474
00:40:12,513 --> 00:40:14,582
They are, but I can't.

475
00:40:17,618 --> 00:40:19,620
I can't.

476
00:41:04,745 --> 00:41:08,388
HONEYMOON

477
00:41:31,658 --> 00:41:33,327
I just wanted to say you were right.

478
00:41:33,361 --> 00:41:36,130
About saving the Saviors
from the satellite outpost.

479
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:40,401
Having them here.

480
00:41:40,434 --> 00:41:43,671
I don't regret what I did.

481
00:41:43,704 --> 00:41:46,740
But you were right.

482
00:41:46,773 --> 00:41:49,810
And Rick was right about not
killing all the Saviors.

483
00:41:51,779 --> 00:41:53,180
He was right.

484
00:41:53,214 --> 00:41:55,716
He was.

485
00:41:55,749 --> 00:41:57,485
Not about Negan.

486
00:41:59,219 --> 00:42:01,755
So what does that mean, Maggie?

487
00:42:01,789 --> 00:42:05,426
We have a lot to do.

488
00:42:05,459 --> 00:42:08,095
We have to build this place up,

489
00:42:08,128 --> 00:42:11,398
make it work better than before,

490
00:42:11,432 --> 00:42:13,834
make it thrive for the
people who live here.

491
00:42:15,969 --> 00:42:18,772
We need our strength,

492
00:42:18,806 --> 00:42:21,742
the ability to defend ourselves better.

493
00:42:21,775 --> 00:42:23,410
We have to have that.

494
00:42:23,444 --> 00:42:26,013
We will.

495
00:42:26,046 --> 00:42:30,351
But Rick and Michonne...

496
00:42:30,384 --> 00:42:35,222
Rick was wrong to do what he did.

497
00:42:35,255 --> 00:42:37,191
Michonne, too.

498
00:42:39,493 --> 00:42:47,301
So we're gonna bide our time,
wait for our moment...

499
00:42:47,334 --> 00:42:49,302
and then we're gonna show him.

500
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,806
Yeah.

501
00:42:54,841 --> 00:42:56,443
We will.

502
00:43:03,016 --> 00:43:06,220
We know you're awake.

503
00:43:06,253 --> 00:43:07,822
I never said I wasn't.

504
00:43:07,855 --> 00:43:10,090
Good.

505
00:43:10,123 --> 00:43:13,627
Because we need to tell you some things.

506
00:43:13,661 --> 00:43:17,398
And you don't have to open your eyes now.

507
00:43:17,431 --> 00:43:20,501
But you're gonna open them soon.

508
00:43:20,534 --> 00:43:25,439
Because we're gonna make
you watch what happens.

509
00:43:25,472 --> 00:43:29,309
And this isn't about who you killed.

510
00:43:29,343 --> 00:43:30,777
No, we've... we killed people.

511
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:33,747
No, this is about what you did to us,

512
00:43:33,781 --> 00:43:36,950
what you did to so many people.

513
00:43:36,983 --> 00:43:39,186
How you made people live for you,

514
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:40,754
how you put people under your boot.

515
00:43:40,787 --> 00:43:42,255
I saved people!

516
00:43:43,624 --> 00:43:45,191
Michonne.

517
00:43:45,225 --> 00:43:47,728
He needs to know.

518
00:43:49,362 --> 00:43:50,831
This isn't a discussion.

519
00:43:50,865 --> 00:43:52,299
We can open up his stitches

520
00:43:52,332 --> 00:43:55,369
for a little while just to remind him.

521
00:43:57,738 --> 00:44:00,474
Carl pictured something better.

522
00:44:02,876 --> 00:44:05,645
All of us working together

523
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:08,015
for something bigger than all of us.

524
00:44:10,383 --> 00:44:12,886
And you'll have a job, too.

525
00:44:13,337 --> 00:44:15,222
Yeah.

526
00:44:15,256 --> 00:44:17,725
You get to be a part of it.

527
00:44:17,758 --> 00:44:21,462
You'll be an example
of what this will be.

528
00:44:21,495 --> 00:44:24,198
We're not gonna kill you.

529
00:44:24,231 --> 00:44:27,735
We're not gonna hurt you.

530
00:44:27,768 --> 00:44:29,970
You're gonna rot in a cell.

531
00:44:30,004 --> 00:44:32,510
For the rest of your life,

532
00:44:32,511 --> 00:44:36,108
day after day.

533
00:44:36,109 --> 00:44:38,078
You're gonna be evidence

534
00:44:38,112 --> 00:44:41,348
that we're makin' a civilization,

535
00:44:41,382 --> 00:44:43,851
something like what we had,

536
00:44:43,884 --> 00:44:45,585
something we're gonna get back.

537
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:48,355
And you get to watch it happen.

538
00:44:48,388 --> 00:44:51,092
And you get to see how wrong you were

539
00:44:51,125 --> 00:44:55,829
about what people can be,
about what life can be.

540
00:44:55,862 --> 00:44:59,265
You, alive, is gonna help show people

541
00:44:59,299 --> 00:45:02,269
that things have changed,

542
00:45:02,303 --> 00:45:08,675
that keepin' you breathing earns
another way, a better way.

543
00:45:08,708 --> 00:45:11,745
That's the part you'll play.

544
00:45:11,779 --> 00:45:16,250
So after all this...

545
00:45:16,283 --> 00:45:19,086
maybe you're good for something.

546
00:45:57,858 --> 00:45:59,593
Thank you.

547
00:46:01,161 --> 00:46:02,797
Thank you.

548
00:46:04,798 --> 00:46:06,600
I understand.

549
00:46:08,536 --> 00:46:10,237
I know now.

550
00:46:12,539 --> 00:46:14,508
You've given me so much...

551
00:46:17,478 --> 00:46:19,913
...after you've given me so much.

552
00:46:27,387 --> 00:46:29,857
I can see.

553
00:46:35,528 --> 00:46:37,364
Dear Carl.

554
00:46:39,299 --> 00:46:41,769
I remember.

555
00:46:48,408 --> 00:46:51,344
I forgot who I was.

556
00:46:51,378 --> 00:46:53,781
You made me remember.

557
00:46:54,855 --> 00:47:00,687
I remember that feeling,
walking with you that day.

558
00:47:00,721 --> 00:47:02,956
Like I finally knew who I was

559
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:05,559
for the first time in my life.

560
00:47:08,929 --> 00:47:11,865
Thing is, we were walking side-by-side,

561
00:47:11,898 --> 00:47:14,929
but you were bringin' me somewhere.

562
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:17,070
Bringin' me here.

563
00:47:17,071 --> 00:47:22,375
Bringin' all of us to
the new world, Carl.

564
00:47:22,409 --> 00:47:25,579
You showed me the new world.

565
00:47:25,612 --> 00:47:30,383
You made it real.

566
00:47:30,417 --> 00:47:32,853
I see it.

567
00:47:32,886 --> 00:47:36,022
I remember.

568
00:47:36,055 --> 00:47:37,658
Dad.

569
00:47:37,659 --> 00:47:41,233
